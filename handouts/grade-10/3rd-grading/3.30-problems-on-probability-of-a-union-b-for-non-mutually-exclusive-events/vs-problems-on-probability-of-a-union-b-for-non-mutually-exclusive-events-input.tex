\noindent Events \( A \) and \( B \) are non-mutually exclusive if they can occur at the same time.%, i.e., \( P(A \cap B) \neq 0 \).

\noindent The probability of \( A \cup B \) (either \( A \), \( B \), or both occurring) is:

{\centering $ 
          P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
          $\par}
        
%\noindent Subtracting \( P(A \cap B) \) avoids double-counting the outcomes common to both events.
