\textbf{Lesson 4.9: Probability as a Measure of Chance}
\end{center}

\vspace*{-1ex}

Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event will not occur and 1 means the event is certain to occur. The probability of an event occurring is calculated using the following formula:

{\centering $ P(\text{event}) = \dfrac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} $\par}
