Solve for the missing angle or arc.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the central angle measures $82^\circ$, what is the measure of its intercepted arc?
 %   \item If the intercepted arc measures $135^\circ$, what is the measure of its central angle?
    \item A central angle measures $65^\circ$. What is the measure of the remaining arc in the circle?
    %\item The minor arc measures $95^\circ$. Find the measure of the major arc.
    \item A semicircle is divided into two arcs. If one arc measures $90^\circ$, find the measure of the other arc.
    %\item If the central angle is $y^\circ$ and the intercepted arc is $4y - 5^\circ$, find $y$.
    \item The sum of two adjacent central angles is $160^\circ$. If one measures $72^\circ$, find the other.
    %\item The central angle of a sector is one-fifth of the full circle. Find its measure.
    \item The intercepted arc is three times the measure of the central angle. If the arc is $195^\circ$, find the angle.
    %\item If a major arc measures $240^\circ$, find the measure of the corresponding minor arc.
\end{enumerate}
