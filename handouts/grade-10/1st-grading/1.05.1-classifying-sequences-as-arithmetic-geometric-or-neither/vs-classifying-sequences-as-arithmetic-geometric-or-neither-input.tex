\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{sequence} is an ordered list of numbers.
    \item A sequence is \textbf{arithmetic} if the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is called the \textbf{common difference} \( d \).
    \item A sequence is \textbf{geometric} if the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. This ratio is called the \textbf{common ratio} \( r \).
    \item A sequence that is neither arithmetic nor geometric is classified as \textbf{neither}.
\end{itemize}
