\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{central angle} is an angle whose vertex is at the \textbf{center} of the circle and whose sides are \textbf{radii}.
    \item The \textbf{intercepted arc} of a central angle is the portion of the circle between the two points where the angle's sides meet the circle.
    \item The measure of a \textbf{central angle} is equal to the degree measure of its \textbf{intercepted arc}.
    \item A full circle has a total of $360^\circ$.
    \item A \textbf{minor arc} is an arc that measures less than $180^\circ$.
    \item A \textbf{major arc} is an arc that measures more than $180^\circ$.
    \item A \textbf{semicircle} is an arc that measures exactly $180^\circ$, formed by a \textbf{diameter}.
    \item The sum of the measures of all arcs in a circle is $360^\circ$.
\end{itemize}
