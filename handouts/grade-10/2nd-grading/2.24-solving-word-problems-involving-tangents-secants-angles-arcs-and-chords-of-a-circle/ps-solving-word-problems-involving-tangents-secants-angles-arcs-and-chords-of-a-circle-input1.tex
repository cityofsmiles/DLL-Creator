Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. One secant intercepts arcs measuring $120^\circ$ and $40^\circ$. Find the measure of the angle formed by the secants.
    \item A secant and a tangent meet at a point outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $100^\circ$ and $30^\circ$. Find the angle formed.
%    \item Two chords intersect inside a circle. One arc measures $60^\circ$ and the other measures $80^\circ$. Find the measure of the angle formed by the intersecting chords.
    \item A tangent to a circle measures $15$ cm. A secant from the same external point has an external segment of $9$ cm and a total length of $x$. Solve for $x$.
 %   \item Two chords intersect in a circle. The segments of the first chord measure $7$ cm and $14$ cm. One segment of the second chord is $10$ cm. Find the other segment.
    \item A tangent measures $20$ cm, and a secant has an external part of $12$ cm and a total length of $x$. Solve for $x$.
  %  \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. One secant intercepts arcs of $140^\circ$ and $50^\circ$. Find the measure of the external angle.
    \item A circle has a secant with an external segment of $11$ cm and a total length of $22$ cm. Find the length of the tangent from the same external point.
  %  \item Two intersecting chords divide into segments measuring $5$ cm and $15$ cm, and $6$ cm and $x$ cm, respectively. Solve for $x$.
    \item A secant has an external segment of $8$ cm and a total length of $24$ cm. Find the length of the tangent from the same external point.
\end{enumerate}
