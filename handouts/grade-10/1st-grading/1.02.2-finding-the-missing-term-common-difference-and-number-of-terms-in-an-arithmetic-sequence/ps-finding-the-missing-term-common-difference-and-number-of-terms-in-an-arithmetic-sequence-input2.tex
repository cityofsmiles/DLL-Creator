Solve for the missing term, common difference, or number of terms in each arithmetic sequence.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the missing term: $3, \_, 9, 12$
    \item Determine the common difference: $4, 8, 12, 16, \dots$
    \item Find the 10th term of the sequence: $2, 6, 10, 14, \dots$
    \item Find the number of terms: $5, 10, 15, ..., 50$
    \item Determine the missing term: $-4, \_, 6, 10$
    \item Identify the common difference: $\dfrac{2}{5}, \dfrac{4}{5}, \dfrac{6}{5}, \dfrac{8}{5}, \dots$
    \item Find the 12th term of the sequence: $7, 14, 21, 28, \dots$
    \item Find the number of terms: $8, 16, 24, ..., 64$
    \item Determine the missing term: $40, \_, 20, 10$
    \item Calculate the common difference: $-9, -5, -1, 3, \dots$
\end{enumerate}
