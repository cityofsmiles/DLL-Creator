\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{arithmetic sequence} is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
    \item The \textbf{common difference}, denoted as $d$, is found using:

{\centering $  d = a_2 - a_1  $\par}
      %\[ d = a_2 - a_1 \]
    \item The \textbf{general term} (nth term) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

{\centering $  a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d  $\par}
      %\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
\noindent     where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a_n$ is the nth term,
        \item $a_1$ is the first term,
        \item $d$ is the common difference, and
        \item $n$ is the term position.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The formula allows us to find any term in the sequence without listing all terms.
\end{itemize}
