\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Fundamental Theorem of Algebra} states that a polynomial equation of degree \( n \) has exactly \( n \) roots (real or complex).
    \item The \textbf{number of zeros} of a polynomial is determined by its highest exponent.
    \item Real roots can be \textbf{rational or irrational}, while complex roots occur in \textbf{conjugate pairs}.
    \item The sum and product of the roots can be determined using \textbf{Vietaâ€™s formulas}.
\end{itemize}
