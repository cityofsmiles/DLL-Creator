    \item In a litter of puppies, 4 have brown fur, and 6 have black fur. What is the probability that a randomly selected puppy has brown fur?
 %   \item A pea plant carries one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b). What is the probability of passing the dominant allele to offspring?
    \item A biologist is studying a population of 40 turtles, and 16 of them have a rare genetic mutation. What is the probability that a randomly caught turtle has this mutation?
    %\item In a greenhouse, there are 5 blue flowers, 7 orange flowers, and 12 pink flowers. What is the probability of randomly selecting an orange flower?
    \item A human has two alleles for hair texture: C (curly) and c (straight). If a parent has genotype Cc, what is the probability that the child inherits the recessive allele (c)?
    %\item A researcher finds that 30\% of a bacterial sample carries an antibiotic resistance gene. What is the probability that a randomly selected bacterium does not carry the gene?
    \item In a group of 60 bats, 18 are carriers of a fungal infection. What is the probability that a randomly selected bat is not a carrier?
    %\item A geneticist studies a sample of 25 beetles. If 9 exhibit a specific shell pattern mutation, what is the probability of selecting a mutated beetle?
    \item A field study finds that 5 out of 30 ferns exposed to acid rain show signs of damage. What is the probability that a randomly selected fern is unaffected?
    %\item A type of mosquito has a 40\% chance of carrying a specific virus. What is the probability that a randomly selected mosquito does not carry the virus?
