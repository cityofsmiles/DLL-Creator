\noindent\textbf{Steps for Solving by Substitution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose one of the equations and solve it for one variable.
    \item Substitute the expression obtained for this variable into the other equation.
    \item Solve the resulting equation for the other variable.
    \item Substitute the value of the solved variable back into one of the original equations to find the value of the first variable.
    \item Check your solution by substituting both values into both original equations.
\end{enumerate}
