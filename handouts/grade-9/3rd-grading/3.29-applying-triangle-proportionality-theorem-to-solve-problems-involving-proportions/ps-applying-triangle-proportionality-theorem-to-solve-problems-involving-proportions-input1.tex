Use the Triangle Proportionality Theorem to solve the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In \(\triangle ABC\), a line parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(D\) and \(AC\) at \(E\). If \(AD = 4\), \(DB = 6\), and \(AE = 5\), find \(EC\).
    \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(PQ \parallel YZ\), \(XP = 3\), \(PY = 4\), and \(XQ = 2\). Find \(QZ\).
    \item A line parallel to the base of a triangle divides the other two sides into segments of \(6\) and \(9\) on one side, and \(8\) and \(x\) on the other side. Find \(x\).
    \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(GH \parallel EF\). If \(DG = 5\), \(GE = 7\), and \(FH = 9\), find \(HD\).
    \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(DE \parallel BC\), \(AD = 6\), \(DB = 9\), and \(DE = 10\). Find \(BC\).
    % \item A triangle is divided by a parallel line into two smaller triangles. If the sides of the larger triangle are proportional to \(2:3\), and one side of the smaller triangle is \(12\), find the corresponding side of the larger triangle.
    % \item In \(\triangle PQR\), \(ST \parallel QR\). If \(PS = 7\), \(SQ = 10\), and \(RT = 8\), find \(TR\).
    % \item In \(\triangle ABC\), a parallel line divides \(AB\) and \(AC\) into segments \(3\) and \(5\), and \(4\) and \(x\), respectively. Find \(x\).
    % \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(AB \parallel XY\), \(ZA = 8\), \(AZ = 12\), and \(XB = 10\). Find \(BY\).
    % \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(GH \parallel EF\), and the segments of \(DE\) are \(4\) and \(6\), while the segments of \(DF\) are \(5\) and \(x\). Find \(x\).
