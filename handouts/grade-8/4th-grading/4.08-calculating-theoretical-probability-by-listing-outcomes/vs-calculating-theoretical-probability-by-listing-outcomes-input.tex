\textbf{Lesson 4.8: Calculating Theoretical Probability by Listing Outcomes}

\vspace*{-1.5ex}

If an event $E$ has $n(E)$ equally likely outcomes and its sample space $S$ has $n(S)$ likely outcomes, then the \emph{probability} of the event $E$ is:


 
{\centering $ P(E) = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(S)} = \dfrac{\text{number of elements in } E}{\text{number of elements in }S} $\par}
