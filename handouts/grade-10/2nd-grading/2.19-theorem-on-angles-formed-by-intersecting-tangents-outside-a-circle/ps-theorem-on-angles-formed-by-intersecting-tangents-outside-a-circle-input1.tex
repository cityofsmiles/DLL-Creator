Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
  %  \item Two tangents intersect outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $150^\circ$ and $50^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    \item Two tangents intersect outside a circle, forming an angle of $50^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $70^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    %\item The intercepted arcs of two tangents measure $180^\circ$ and $60^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    \item Two tangents intersect outside a circle. The exterior angle measures $60^\circ$, and the minor intercepted arc is $90^\circ$. Find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    %\item Find the measure of the exterior angle formed by two tangents intercepting arcs measuring $170^\circ$ and $70^\circ$.
    \item A tangent-tangent angle measures $55^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc is $160^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    %\item Two tangents form an exterior angle of $70^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $100^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    \item The exterior angle formed by two tangents is $55^\circ$. The intercepted arcs differ by $80^\circ$. Find their measures.
    %\item Two tangents intersect outside a circle, creating an angle of $52^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc measures $170^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    \item The intercepted arcs of two tangents measure $200^\circ$ and $120^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
