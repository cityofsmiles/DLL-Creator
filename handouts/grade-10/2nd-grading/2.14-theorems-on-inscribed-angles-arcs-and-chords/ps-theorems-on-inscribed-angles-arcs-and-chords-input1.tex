Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Find the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts an arc measuring $120^\circ$.
    \item Two inscribed angles subtend the same arc. If one of them measures $40^\circ$, find the measure of the other.
   % \item A chord of a circle has a length of $10$ cm. If the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord is $4$ cm, find the radius of the circle.
    \item In a circle, a central angle measures $100^\circ$. Find the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
    %\item A tangent and a chord intersect at a point on the circle. If the angle between them measures $35^\circ$, find the measure of the intercepted arc.
    \item Find the length of a chord that is $8$ cm away from the center of a circle with a radius of $10$ cm.
    %\item Two chords of a circle are congruent. Show that they are equidistant from the center.
    \item If an inscribed angle is $45^\circ$, find the measure of the intercepted arc.
    %\item Find the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords that intercept arcs measuring $80^\circ$ and $60^\circ$.
    \item If the radius of a circle is $13$ cm and a chord is $12$ cm long, find its distance from the center.
