Solve the following problems involving right triangles.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In a right triangle, the legs measure 6 cm and 8 cm. Find the hypotenuse.
    \item A ladder leans against a wall, making a \(60^\circ\) angle with the ground. If the ladder is 10 ft long, find how far up the wall it reaches.
    \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), \(AB = 13\), and \(AC = 12\). Find \(BC\).
    \item A ramp makes a \(30^\circ\) angle with the ground and is 15 ft long. Find the height of the ramp above the ground.
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse measures 25 cm and one leg is 24 cm. Find the other leg.
    \item An observer is standing 50 m away from the base of a tower. The angle of elevation to the top of the tower is \(45^\circ\). Find the height of the tower.
    % \item A triangle has sides measuring 9 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm. Verify if it is a right triangle.
    % \item A kite string is 20 m long and makes a \(40^\circ\) angle with the ground. Find the vertical height of the kite.
    % 
    % \item A ladder is 12 ft long and reaches a height of 9 ft on a wall. Find the angle it makes with the ground.
