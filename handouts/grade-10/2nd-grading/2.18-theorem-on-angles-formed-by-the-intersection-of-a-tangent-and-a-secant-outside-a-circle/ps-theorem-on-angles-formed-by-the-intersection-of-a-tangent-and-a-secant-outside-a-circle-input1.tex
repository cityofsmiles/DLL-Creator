Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item A tangent and a secant intersect outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $140^\circ$ and $60^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    \item A tangent and a secant intersect outside a circle, forming an angle of $45^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $70^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    %\item The intercepted arcs of a tangent and a secant measure $160^\circ$ and $80^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    \item A tangent and a secant intersect outside a circle. The exterior angle measures $50^\circ$, and the minor intercepted arc is $100^\circ$. Find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
