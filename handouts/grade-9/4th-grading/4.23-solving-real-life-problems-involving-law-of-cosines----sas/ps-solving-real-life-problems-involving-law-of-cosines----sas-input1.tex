Solve the following real-life problems using the Law of Cosines.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two towers are 50 m and 70 m tall, and the distance between their bases is 100 m. The angle between the lines of sight from the top of each tower to the ground is \(60^\circ\). Find the distance between the tops of the towers.
    \item A triangular plot of land has two adjacent sides measuring 40 m and 60 m with an included angle of \(45^\circ\). Find the length of the third side of the triangle.
    \item A ship travels 5 km north, then turns \(120^\circ\) to its right and travels 8 km. Find the distance between the starting and ending points of the ship.
    \item A triangular garden has sides of 25 m and 35 m forming an angle of \(75^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    \item A triangular parcel of land has sides of 120 m and 150 m forming an angle of \(30^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    % \item Two points on a mountain are connected by paths of lengths 500 m and 700 m, forming an angle of \(110^\circ\). Find the straight-line distance between the two points.
    % \item A kite is flying 100 m away from a point on the ground. The string forms an angle of \(50^\circ\) with the ground, and the distance between the kite and a nearby tree is 90 m. Find the distance between the point on the ground and the tree.
    % \item A triangular swimming pool has two sides measuring 15 m and 20 m, with an included angle of \(60^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    % \item Two airplanes flying at the same altitude are 200 km and 300 km away from an air traffic control tower, forming an angle of \(40^\circ\) between their flight paths. Find the distance between the airplanes.
    % \item A triangular roof truss has sides of 10 m and 12 m forming an angle of \(70^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
