\item A projectile is launched from a point above the ground. The height at ground level is given by the equation $ h = -3t^{2} + 24t $, where $h$ is the height in meters and $t$ is the time in seconds.

%\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[label = \color{blue}\alph*. ]
%1
\item What is the maximum height it can be reach?
%2
\item How long will it take to reach the maximum height?
%3
\item How many seconds after the launch will the projectile hit the ground?
\end{enumerate}

\item An object is thrown vertically upward with a velocity of 95 m/sec. The distance $S(t)$ above the ground after $t$ seconds is given by the formula $S(t) = 96t - 5t^{2}$.
%\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[label = \color{blue}\alph*. ]
%1
\item How high will it be at the end of 3 seconds?
%2
\item How much time will it take the object to be 172 m above the ground after thrown vertically?
%3
\item How long will it take the object to reach the ground?
\end{enumerate}

%3
\item A ball was thrown in the air above the ground and the height is given by the equation $ h = -3t^{2} + 12t $, in meters, where $t$ is the time in seconds that the ball has been in the air. What is the maximum height the ball can reach?
