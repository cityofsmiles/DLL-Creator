Solve the following problems completely.

\begin{enumerate}
    % \item A person is standing on a 40-meter-high building. The angle of depression to a car parked on the ground is \(35^\circ\). Find the distance of the car from the base of the building.

    % \item From the top of a lighthouse, 100 meters above sea level, the angle of depression to a boat is \(50^\circ\). How far is the boat from the base of the lighthouse?

    % \item A bird is perched on a tree 30 meters high. The angle of depression to a fish in a pond is \(45^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance between the bird and the fish.

    % \item A firefighter on a ladder 20 meters above the ground sees a fire on the ground at an angle of depression of \(30^\circ\). Find the distance from the ladder to the fire.

    % \item A person on a cliff observes a ship at an angle of depression of \(25^\circ\). If the height of the cliff is 150 meters, find the horizontal distance between the person and the ship.

    \item A drone is flying 100 meters above the ground. The angle of depression to a target on the ground is \(40^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the target.

    \item From the top of a hill, 180 meters above the ground, the angle of depression to a house is \(30^\circ\). Calculate the horizontal distance to the house.

    \item A skier is standing on a hill 50 meters tall. The angle of depression to the base of the hill is \(40^\circ\). Find the length of the slope.

    \item A pilot flying at an altitude of 800 meters sees the runway at an angle of depression of \(20^\circ\). How far is the plane horizontally from the runway?

    \item From the top of a tower 75 meters high, the angle of depression to a car is \(33^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance from the tower to the car.
