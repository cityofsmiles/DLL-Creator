Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A central angle in a circle measures $120^\circ$. If the radius of the circle is $10$ cm, find the length of the intercepted arc.
 %   \item The measure of an inscribed angle is $35^\circ$. Find the measure of its intercepted arc.
    \item A chord is $16$ cm long and is $6$ cm away from the center of the circle. Find the radius of the circle.
    %\item Find the area of a sector with a central angle of $90^\circ$ in a circle of radius $8$ cm.
    \item A major arc measures $260^\circ$. Find the measure of the corresponding minor arc.
    %\item The measure of an inscribed angle is $50^\circ$. What is the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc?
    \item A circle has a radius of $14$ cm. Find the area of a sector with a central angle of $72^\circ$.
    %\item A chord is $20$ cm long and is $8$ cm away from the center of the circle. Find the radius of the circle.
    \item The length of an arc in a circle is $15.7$ cm, and the central angle is $120^\circ$. Find the radius of the circle.
    %\item Find the length of an arc intercepted by a $45^\circ$ central angle in a circle of radius $9$ cm.
