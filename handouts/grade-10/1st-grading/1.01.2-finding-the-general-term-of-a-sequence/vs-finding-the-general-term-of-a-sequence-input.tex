\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{sequence} is an ordered list of numbers following a specific pattern.
    \item The \textbf{general term} (or \textbf{nth term}) of a sequence, denoted as $a_n$, provides a formula to find any term in the sequence.
    \item A sequence is \textbf{linear} if it follows an arithmetic pattern, where each term increases or decreases by a common difference.
    \item The general form of a linear sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.
    \item To determine the nth term, identify the common difference and use known terms to form the equation.
