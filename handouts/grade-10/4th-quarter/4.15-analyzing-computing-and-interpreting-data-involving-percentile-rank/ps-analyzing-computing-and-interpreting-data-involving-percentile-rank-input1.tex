For each dataset, calculate and interpret the percentile rank of the given value \(X\):  

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dataset: \(10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55\); \(X = 30\)  
    \item Dataset: \(5, 8, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50\); \(X = 20\)  
    \item Dataset: \(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30\); \(X = 15\)  
    \item Dataset: \(7, 10, 14, 17, 20, 24, 27, 31, 35, 39\); \(X = 24\)  
    \item Dataset: \(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\); \(X = 12\)  
    \item Dataset: \(8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44\); \(X = 36\)  
    \item Dataset: \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\); \(X = 11\)  
    \item Dataset: \(6, 9, 13, 16, 19, 22, 26, 29, 32, 35\); \(X = 26\)  
    \item Dataset: \(4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40\); \(X = 24\)  
    \item Dataset: \(11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47\); \(X = 35\)
