\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{infinite geometric series} is the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric sequence.
    \item The series is \textbf{convergent} if the absolute value of the common ratio \( r \) is less than 1 (i.e., \( |r| < 1 \)).
    \item The series is \textbf{divergent} if the absolute value of the common ratio is greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., \( |r| \geq 1 \)).
    \item If the series is convergent, its sum is given by the formula:

{\centering $  S = \dfrac{a_1}{1 - r}, \quad \text{for } |r| < 1  $\par}
      %\[ S = \dfrac{a_1}{1 - r}, \quad \text{for } |r| < 1 \]
          where:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \( S \) is the sum of the infinite series,
              \item \( a_1 \) is the first term, and
              \item \( r \) is the common ratio.
          \end{itemize}
    \item If the series is divergent, its sum does not exist.
\end{itemize}
