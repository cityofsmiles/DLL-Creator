Use the distance and/or midpoint formula to prove the given geometric properties.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that the triangle with vertices $A(2,3)$, $B(6,7)$, and $C(10,3)$ is isosceles.
  %  \item Prove that the quadrilateral with vertices $P(1,2)$, $Q(5,6)$, $R(9,2)$, and $S(5,-2)$ is a rhombus.
    \item Find the midpoint of the diagonal of the rectangle with vertices at $(-3,2)$ and $(5,10)$.
    %\item Show that the line segment joining $A(-4,-1)$ and $B(4,5)$ is bisected by point $M(0,2)$.
    \item Prove that the triangle with vertices $X(3,4)$, $Y(7,8)$, and $Z(3,12)$ is isosceles.
    %\item Determine whether the quadrilateral with vertices $K(-2,-1)$, $L(4,5)$, $M(10,-1)$, and $N(4,-7)$ is a parallelogram.
    \item Prove that the line segment with endpoints $C(1,-2)$ and $D(7,6)$ is bisected by point $E(4,2)$.
    %\item Show that the rectangle with opposite corners at $(-5,3)$ and $(7,9)$ has a diagonal midpoint at $(1,6)$.
    \item Verify that the triangle with vertices $P(2,1)$, $Q(6,5)$, and $R(10,1)$ is isosceles.
    %\item Prove that the quadrilateral with vertices $A(3,2)$, $B(9,6)$, $C(15,2)$, and $D(9,-2)$ is a rhombus.
\end{enumerate}
