\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{geometric sequence} is a sequence in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the \textbf{common ratio}, denoted as $r$.
    \item The general form of a geometric sequence is:

{\centering $  a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \dots  $\par}
    %   \[ a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \dots 
    % \]
\noindent     where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a$ is the first term,
        \item $r$ is the common ratio (found by dividing any term by the previous term), and
        \item Each term is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by $r$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The $n$th term of a geometric sequence is given by:

{\centering $  a_n = a r^{n-1}  $\par}
      %\[ a_n = a r^{n-1} \]
    \item Geometric sequences can be increasing ($r > 1$) or decreasing ($0 < r < 1$).
\end{itemize}
