\noindent\textbf{Independent Events:} Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

{\centering $     P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) $\par}

\noindent \textbf{Dependent Events:} Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.

{\centering $     P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) $\par}

\noindent     where \( P(B|A) \) is the conditional probability of \( B \) given \( A \).
