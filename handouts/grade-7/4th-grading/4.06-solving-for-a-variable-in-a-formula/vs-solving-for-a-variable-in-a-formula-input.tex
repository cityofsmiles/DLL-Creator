A formula expresses a relationship between variables. Solving one variable in terms of others involves rearranging the formula using algebraic operations.

\noindent Example:\\
Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(y = 3x + 5\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
    y &= 3x + 5 \\
    y - 5 &= 3x \quad \text{(subtract 5 from both sides)} \\
    x &= \dfrac{y - 5}{3} \quad \text{(divide both sides by 3)}
\end{aligned}
\]
