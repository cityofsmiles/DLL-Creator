Use the appropriate special right triangle theorem to solve for unknown side lengths.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In a \(45°-45°-90°\) triangle, one leg measures \(9\). Calculate the hypotenuse.
    \item In a \(30°-60°-90°\) triangle, the shorter leg measures \(7\). Calculate the longer leg and the hypotenuse.
    \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(\angle D = 45^\circ\) and \(\angle E = 45^\circ\), and the hypotenuse is \(12\). Find the length of each leg.
    \item In a \(30°-60°-90°\) triangle, the hypotenuse is \(18\). Calculate the lengths of the shorter and longer legs.
    \item A \(45°-45°-90°\) triangle has a hypotenuse of \(6\sqrt{2}\). Find the lengths of the legs.
    % \item In a 30°-60°-90° triangle, the longer leg is \(8\sqrt{3}\). Prove similarity and find the lengths of the shorter leg and hypotenuse.
    % \item In a 45°-45°-90° triangle, the legs measure \(10\). Prove similarity and calculate the hypotenuse.
    % \item In \(\triangle GHI\), \(\angle G = 30^\circ\), \(\angle H = 60^\circ\), and the hypotenuse is \(16\). Find the lengths of the legs.
    % \item A 45°-45°-90° triangle has one leg measuring \(13\). Prove similarity and calculate the hypotenuse.
    % \item In a 30°-60°-90° triangle, the shorter leg is \(4\). Prove similarity and find the longer leg and the hypotenuse.
