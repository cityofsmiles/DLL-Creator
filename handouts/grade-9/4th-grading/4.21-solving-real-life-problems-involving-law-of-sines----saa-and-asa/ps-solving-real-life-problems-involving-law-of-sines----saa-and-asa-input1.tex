Solve the following real-life problems using the Law of Sines.  

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A surveyor is measuring the width of a river. From one bank, the angle to a tree directly across the river is \(40^\circ\). From a point 50 m along the bank, the angle to the tree is \(70^\circ\). Find the width of the river.
    \item A drone is flying at an altitude of 120 m. From a point directly below the drone, the angle of elevation to the top of a tower is \(55^\circ\), and the angle of elevation to the drone is \(35^\circ\). Find the height of the tower.
    \item Two ships at sea are 100 km apart. From one ship, the angles to a lighthouse are \(30^\circ\) and \(50^\circ\). Find the distance from the first ship to the lighthouse.
    \item A tree casts a shadow 15 m long when the angle of elevation of the sun is \(60^\circ\). A nearby pole casts a shadow with an angle of elevation of \(45^\circ\). Find the height of the pole.
    \item A hot air balloon is flying at an altitude of 200 m. The angle of elevation to the balloon from two points 100 m apart on the ground is \(30^\circ\) and \(45^\circ\). Find the distance of the balloon from the closer point.
    % \item A triangular park has sides measuring 200 m and 150 m, with an included angle of \(40^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    % \item A lighthouse beam forms angles of \(60^\circ\) and \(70^\circ\) with two ships at sea. If the distance between the ships is 500 m, find the distance of each ship from the lighthouse.
    % \item A cyclist travels 10 km due north, then turns and travels at an angle of \(120^\circ\) to the original direction for 15 km. How far is the cyclist from the starting point?
    % \item A tower is 50 m tall. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is \(30^\circ\), and the angle to the top of a nearby hill is \(60^\circ\). If the tower is 200 m from the hill, find the height of the hill.
    % \item Two airplanes are flying at the same altitude. The angles of elevation from an observer on the ground to the airplanes are \(45^\circ\) and \(60^\circ\). If the airplanes are 500 m apart, find the distance of each airplane from the observer.
