   \item The total earnings of a worker; $E = hrw$ where $h$ is the number of hours worked, $r$ is the rate, and $w$ is the number of weeks.
   \item The volume of a sphere; $V = \dfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3$
   \item The surface area of a rectangular prism; $A = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh$
   \item The electric force between two charges; $F = k \dfrac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$
   \item The kinetic energy of an object; $KE = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$
   \item The electric field of a point charge; $E = k \dfrac{Q}{r^2}$
   \item The volume of an ideal gas; $V = \dfrac{nRT}{P}$
   \item The work done by a force; $W = Fd$
   \item The frequency of a pendulum; $f = \dfrac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\dfrac{g}{L}}$
   \item The force on a spring; $F = kx$
