\noindent A. Complete the following exercises by indicating the sets using either the \textbf{roster method} or the \textbf{rule method}.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*. , noitemsep]
    \item Write the set of all vowels in the alphabet using the roster method.
    \item Write the set of all even numbers between 1 and 10 using the rule method.
    \item Write the set of prime numbers less than 20 using the roster method.
    \item Write the set of natural numbers greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15 using the rule method.
    \item Write the set of the first five multiples of 3 using the roster method.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent B. Determine if the first set is a subset of the second set. Write your answer as either \textbf{true} or \textbf{false}. 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*. , noitemsep]
    \item \( A = \{2, 4\}, B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \)
    \item \( S = \{a, b, c\}, T = \{a, b, c, d, e\} \)
    \item \( X = \{x | x \text{ is a prime number less than 10}\}, Y = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\} \)
    \item \( M = \{n | n \text{ is a multiple of 3 and } n \leq 15\}, N = \{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18\} \)
    \item \( P = \emptyset, Q = \{0, 1\} \)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent C. Find the cardinality of each set and state whether the set is finite or infinite.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*. , noitemsep]
    \item \( A = \{a, b, c, d\} \)
    \item \( B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\} \)
    \item \( C = \{x | x \text{ is an integer greater than 0 and less than 10}\} \)
    \item \( D = \{x | x \text{ is a multiple of 5}\} \)
    \item \( E = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\} \)
\end{enumerate}
