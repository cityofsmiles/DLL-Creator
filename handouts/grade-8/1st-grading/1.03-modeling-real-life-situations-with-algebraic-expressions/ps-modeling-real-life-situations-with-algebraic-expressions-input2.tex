\begin{enumerate}

    \item The total weight \( W \) of \( m \) identical cans, each weighing \( n \) grams.
    \item The perimeter \( P \) of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
    \item The amount of fuel \( F \) used by a truck that consumes \( c \) liters per 10 kilometers over a distance of \( d \) kilometers.
    \item The total earnings \( E \) of a freelancer who works \( h \) hours at an hourly rate of \( r \).
    \item The temperature \( T \) after \( x \) days, if the temperature decreases by 3 degrees each day starting from 25 degrees.
        \item The cost \( C \) of buying \( x \) bananas at \pesos 5 each.
    \item The total distance \( D \) traveled by a train moving at a constant speed \( r \) for \( t \) hours.
    \item The amount of money \( M \) you have after adding \pesos 15 to the amount you already have, which is \( x \).
    \item The area \( A \) of a rectangle with length \( l \) and width \( w \), where \( w \) is given as \( 3x \).
    \item The total cost \( T \) of \( y \) concert tickets, if each ticket costs \pesos 125.
