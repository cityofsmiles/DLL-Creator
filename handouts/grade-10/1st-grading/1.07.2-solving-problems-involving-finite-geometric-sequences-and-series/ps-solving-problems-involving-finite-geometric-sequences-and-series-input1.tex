Solve the following problems involving finite geometric sequences and series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the 12th term of the geometric sequence: \(2, 6, 18, 54, \dots\)
    \item Determine the sum of the first 8 terms of the geometric sequence: \(5, 10, 20, 40, \dots\)
    \item The first term of a geometric sequence is 4, and the common ratio is 3. Find the 7th term.
    \item If the 4th term of a geometric sequence is 16 and the 7th term is 128, find the common ratio.
    \item Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric sequence: \(3, 6, 12, 24, \dots\)
    \item A person deposits \$500 in a bank, and the amount triples each year. Find the amount after 5 years.
    \item Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the geometric sequence: \(1, 2, 4, 8, \dots\)
    \item A bacteria culture doubles in number every hour. If the initial count is 100, find the population after 6 hours.
    \item The first term of a geometric sequence is \(1\), and the common ratio is \(4\). Find the 9th term.
    \item A person invests \$1000 in a fund that grows at a rate of 5\% annually. Find the total amount after 6 years.
