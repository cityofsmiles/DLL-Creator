Find the measure of the missing angle or arc.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item If the central angle measures $75^\circ$, what is the measure of its intercepted arc?
    \item If the intercepted arc measures $120^\circ$, what is the measure of its central angle?
    %\item A central angle measures $50^\circ$. What is the measure of the remaining arc in the circle?
    \item The minor arc measures $110^\circ$. Find the measure of the major arc.
    %\item A semicircle is divided into two arcs. If one arc measures $85^\circ$, find the measure of the other arc.
    \item If the central angle is $x^\circ$ and the intercepted arc is $3x + 10^\circ$, find $x$.
    %\item The sum of two adjacent central angles is $150^\circ$. If one measures $65^\circ$, find the other.
    \item The central angle of a sector is one-fourth of the full circle. Find its measure.
    %\item The intercepted arc is twice the measure of the central angle. If the arc is $160^\circ$, find the angle.
    \item If a major arc measures $220^\circ$, find the measure of the corresponding minor arc.
\end{enumerate}
