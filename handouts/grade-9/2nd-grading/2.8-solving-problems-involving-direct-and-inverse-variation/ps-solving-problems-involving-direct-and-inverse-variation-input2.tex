\item The time to complete a project varies inversely as the number of employees. If 7 people can complete a project in 10 days, how long would it take 15 people to finish the same project?
  
\item The surface area of a sphere varies directly as the square of the radius $r$. If the surface area is 36\pi~cm when $r = 3$ cm, find the surface area of a sphere with radius 2 cm.

\item Suppose 4 people can paint a house in 3 days. How long would it take 5 people to paint the same house?
  
\item The distance of an object falling from rest varies directly as the square of the time it has fallen. If the object fell 2 ft during the first half second, how far did it fall during the next two seconds?
  
\item The distance at which one should sit from the support seesaw is inversely propotional to his weight. If a boy who weighs 45 kilograms sits 2 meters from the support, how far from the support should a 36 kilogram boy sit for him to be balance?

%\item The volume varies inversely with the pressure for any gas at a constant temperature in an enclosed space. Supposing a gas at constant temperature occupies 15.3 liters at a pressure of 40 millimeters of mercury, find the volume of the same gas at a pressure of 36 millimeters of mercury.
