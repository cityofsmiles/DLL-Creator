Solve each problem completely.
\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item Find the measure of a central angle that intercepts an arc measuring $95^\circ$.
    \item A chord is 5 cm away from the center of a circle with a radius of 13 cm. Find the length of the chord.
    %\item Two congruent chords intercept arcs measuring $60^\circ$ each. What is the measure of each central angle?
    \item A radius bisects a chord of length 10 cm. Find the distance of the chord from the center.
    %\item If an arc measures $140^\circ$, what is the measure of its corresponding central angle?
    \item Two chords are equidistant from the center of a circle. If one chord measures 16 cm, find the length of the other chord.
    %\item A chord of a circle is 10 cm long and is 6 cm from the center. Find the radius of the circle.
    \item A circle has a central angle measuring $80^\circ$. Find the measure of the intercepted arc.
    %\item Two congruent chords intercept arcs of equal measure. If one arc is $110^\circ$, find the measure of the other arc.
    \item If a radius bisects a chord and is perpendicular to it, what conclusion can be drawn about the chord?
\end{enumerate}
