Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A point outside a circle has two tangents drawn to the circle. If one tangent measures $15$ cm, find the length of the other tangent.
  %  \item Two circles have a common external tangent of length $20$ cm. Find the distance between their centers if their radii are $8$ cm and $6$ cm.
    \item Two tangents are drawn from an external point to a circle. If the central angle subtended by the tangents is $120^\circ$, find the measure of the angle formed by the two tangents outside the circle.
 %   \item A secant and a tangent intersect outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $100^\circ$ and $40^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle formed.
    \item Find the length of a common internal tangent between two circles with radii $10$ cm and $4$ cm, and a center-to-center distance of $26$ cm.
  %  \item A tangent segment measures $12$ cm. A secant segment drawn from the same external point has an external portion of $9$ cm and an internal portion of $15$ cm. Verify the power of a point theorem.
    \item A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to a radius at the point of tangency. If the radius measures $10$ cm and the external point is $26$ cm away from the center, find the length of the tangent segment.
 %   \item Two circles with radii $5$ cm and $3$ cm have a common external tangent measuring $24$ cm. Find the distance between their centers.
    \item A secant segment and a tangent segment are drawn from an external point. The secant has an external portion of $8$ cm and an internal portion of $10$ cm. Find the length of the tangent segment.
%    \item Two circles have radii of $7$ cm and $9$ cm, with a distance of $40$ cm between their centers. Find the length of their common internal tangent.
\end{enumerate}
