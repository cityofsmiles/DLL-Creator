Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $120^\circ$ and $40^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
 %   \item Two secants intersect outside a circle, forming an angle of $35^\circ$. If one intercepted arc measures $90^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    \item The intercepted arcs of two secants measure $140^\circ$ and $80^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
   % \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. The exterior angle measures $50^\circ$, and one intercepted arc is $130^\circ$. Find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    \item Find the measure of the exterior angle formed by two secants intercepting arcs measuring $160^\circ$ and $100^\circ$.
  %  \item A secant-secant angle measures $45^\circ$. If one of the intercepted arcs is $110^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    \item Two secants form an exterior angle of $60^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $90^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    %\item The exterior angle formed by two secants is $55^\circ$. The intercepted arcs differ by $40^\circ$. Find their measures.
    \item Two secants intersect outside a circle, creating an angle of $42^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc measures $130^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    %\item The intercepted arcs of two secants measure $180^\circ$ and $110^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
