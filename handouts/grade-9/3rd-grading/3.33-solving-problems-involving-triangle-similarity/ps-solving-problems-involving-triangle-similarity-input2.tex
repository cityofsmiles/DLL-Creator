Solve the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}
    % \item In $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$, $AB = 9$ cm, $AC = 12$ cm, and $DE = 6$ cm. Find $DF$.
    % \item In $\triangle XYZ \sim \triangle PQR$, $XY = 8$ cm, $XZ = 20$ cm, and $PQ = 16$ cm. Find $PR$.
    % \item Two triangles are similar, and their side lengths are in the ratio $2:7$. If the shortest side of the smaller triangle is $6$ cm, find the length of the corresponding side in the larger triangle.
    % \item In $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$, $\angle A = 50^\circ$, $\angle B = 70^\circ$. Find $\angle E$ and $\angle F$.
    \item A telephone pole casts a shadow of $15$ m, while a nearby post casts a shadow of $5$ m. If the post is $2.5$ m tall, how tall is the telephone pole?
    \item In $\triangle LMN \sim \triangle OPQ$, $LM = 10$ cm, $LN = 14$ cm, and $OP = 20$ cm. Find $OQ$.
    \item In two similar triangles, the ratio of their areas is $9:16$. If the perimeter of the smaller triangle is $27$ cm, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?
    \item In $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle XYZ$, $BC = 18$ cm, $AB = 12$ cm, and $XY = 8$ cm. Find $YZ$.
    \item Two triangles are similar, and their corresponding heights are $3$ cm and $6$ cm. If the area of the smaller triangle is $12$ cm$^2$, find the area of the larger triangle.
 %   \item A flagpole $9$ m long casts a shadow of $4$ m. A nearby pole casts a shadow of $2$ m. Are the two poles proportionally similar? Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}
