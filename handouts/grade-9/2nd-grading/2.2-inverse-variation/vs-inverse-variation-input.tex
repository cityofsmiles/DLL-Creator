\textbf{Inverse Variation:} involves a relation of two quantities, $x$ and $y$, wherein, as $x$ increases $y$ decreases, or when $y$ increases $x$ decreases and that their product remains constant

 So, if $y$ varies inversely as $x$ or $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$, then the equation will be $y = \dfrac{k}{x}$ or $k = xy$ where $k$ is the \textbf{constant of variation} or \textbf{constant of relationship}.
