Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item A central angle in a circle measures $150^\circ$. If the radius of the circle is $12$ cm, find the length of the intercepted arc.
    \item The measure of an inscribed angle is $40^\circ$. Find the measure of its intercepted arc.
    %\item A chord is $18$ cm long and is $7$ cm away from the center of the circle. Find the radius of the circle.
    \item Find the area of a sector with a central angle of $120^\circ$ in a circle of radius $10$ cm.
    %\item A major arc measures $240^\circ$. Find the measure of the corresponding minor arc.
    \item The measure of an inscribed angle is $45^\circ$. What is the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc?
    %\item A circle has a radius of $16$ cm. Find the area of a sector with a central angle of $60^\circ$.
    \item A chord is $22$ cm long and is $9$ cm away from the center of the circle. Find the radius of the circle.
    %\item The length of an arc in a circle is $18.5$ cm, and the central angle is $135^\circ$. Find the radius of the circle.
