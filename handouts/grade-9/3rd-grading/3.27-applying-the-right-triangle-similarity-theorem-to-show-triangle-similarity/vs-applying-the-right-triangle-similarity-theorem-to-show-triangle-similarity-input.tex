\noindent\textbf{Right Triangle Similarity Theorem}:
    If an altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, it divides the triangle into two smaller triangles that are similar to each other and to the original triangle.


\noindent \textbf{Steps for Applying the Right Triangle Similarity Theorem:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identify Given Triangles:} Analyze the right triangle and determine the relationships formed by the altitude.
    \item \textbf{Write Similarity Statements:} Identify pairs of similar triangles and write their similarity statements.
    \item \textbf{Set Up Proportions:} Use the similarity relationships to set up proportions between the corresponding sides.
    \item \textbf{Solve for Missing Values:} Use the proportions to solve for unknown side lengths or verify the similarity of triangles.
\end{enumerate}
