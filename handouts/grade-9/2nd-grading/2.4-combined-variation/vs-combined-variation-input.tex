\noindent\textbf{Combined Variation:} is a combination of direct and inverse variations and describes a relationship where a variable
depends on two or more other variables, varies directly with some of them
and inversely with other

If $y$ varies directly to $x$ and inversely to $z$, then $y = \dfrac{kx}{z}$ or $\dfrac{yz}{x} = k$.
