\textbf{Volume:} the amount of space occupied by a solid figure and is measured in cubic units

\textbf{Cylinder:} a solid figure consisting of two parallel circular bases, joined by a curved surface

The volume of a cylinder is given by:

{\centering $ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \text{(area of the base)(height)} = \pi r^{2}h $\par}
