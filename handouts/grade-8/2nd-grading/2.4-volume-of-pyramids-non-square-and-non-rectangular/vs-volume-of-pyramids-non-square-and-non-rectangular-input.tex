%\vspace*{1ex}

     \textbf{Pyramid:} A pyramid is a solid with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a common point called the apex.
     
     \textbf{Base:} The polygonal face of the pyramid that is opposite the apex. It can be triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, etc.
     
     \textbf{Apex:} The highest point of the pyramid where all triangular faces meet.
     
     \textbf{Height:} The perpendicular distance from the apex to the base.
     
     \textbf{Slant height:} The distance from the apex to any point along the edge of the base.
     
     \textbf{Volume:} a mathematical quantity that shows the amount of three-dimensional space occupied by an object or a closed surface. The unit of volume is in cubic units such as $m^3$, $cm^3$, $in^3$ etc.
