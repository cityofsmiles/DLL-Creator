Solve the following problems. They are similar to the ones above but with different values.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A rectangle has a length of $x+5$ and a width of $x-3$. Express its area as a polynomial.
%    \item The volume of a box is given by $V = x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x$. Factor the polynomial to find possible dimensions of the box.
    \item A quadratic function models the height $h(t) = -16t^2 + 80t$ of a projectile. Find the time when the projectile reaches the ground.
  %  \item The revenue from selling $x$ items is given by $R(x) = -3x^2 + 36x$. Determine the number of items that maximizes revenue.
    \item A cube has a volume of $x^3 + 7x^2 + 12x + 8$. Factor the polynomial and determine the possible integer side lengths.
    %\item The sum of two consecutive integers is expressed as $x^2 + x$. Find the integers if their sum is 30.
    \item A carâ€™s distance traveled is modeled by $d(t) = 4t^2 + 6t$. Find $d(5)$.
    %\item The cost to produce $x$ items is given by $C(x) = 6x^2 - 30x + 60$. Find the cost when $x = 12$.
    \item The area of a triangle is given by $A = \dfrac{1}{2} (x^2 + 6x)$. Find the area when $x = 8$.
    %\item A rectangular garden has an area given by $A = x^2 + 7x + 10$. Factor to find possible dimensions of the garden.
\end{enumerate}
