Solve for the missing angle or arc measure.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If an inscribed angle measures $45^\circ$, find the measure of its intercepted arc.
 %   \item If an intercepted arc measures $130^\circ$, find the measure of the inscribed angle that intercepts it.
    \item Two inscribed angles intercept the same arc. If one measures $50^\circ$, what is the measure of the other?
   % \item An angle is inscribed in a semicircle. What is its measure?
    \item An inscribed angle measures $y^\circ$ and its intercepted arc measures $4y^\circ$. Find $y$.
    %\item In a cyclic quadrilateral, one angle measures $78^\circ$. Find the measure of its opposite angle.
    \item An inscribed angle intercepts an arc that is $140^\circ$. Find the measure of the angle.
    %\item A chord divides a circle into two arcs. The larger arc measures $275^\circ$. Find the measure of the smaller arc.
    \item The sum of two adjacent inscribed angles is $140^\circ$. If one measures $5z + 10^\circ$ and the other is $3z^\circ$, find $z$.
    %\item If an intercepted arc measures $5x + 15^\circ$ and the inscribed angle that intercepts it measures $2.5x + 5^\circ$, find $x$.
\end{enumerate}
