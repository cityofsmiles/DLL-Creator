\textbf{Direct Variation:} a relationship between two quantities, $x$ and $y$, where, as $x$ increases $y$ also increases or as $y$ decreases, $x$ also decreases and the ratio between them is constant or the same for all given values of the variables

So if $y$ varies directly as $x$, then we say $y = kx$ or $ k = \dfrac{y}{x}$ and $k$ is called the \textbf{constant of variation}  or \textbf{constant of proportionality}.
