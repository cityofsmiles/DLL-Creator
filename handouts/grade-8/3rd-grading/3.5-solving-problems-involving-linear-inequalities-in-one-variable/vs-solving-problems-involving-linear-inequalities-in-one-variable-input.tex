    \item \textbf{Read the problem carefully:} Understand what is being asked and identify the key information.
    \item \textbf{Translate the situation into an inequality:} Use variables and inequality symbols ($<$, $>$, $\leq$, $\geq$) to represent the problem mathematically.
    \item \textbf{Solve the inequality:} Use algebraic techniques to isolate the variable and solve the inequality.
    \item \textbf{Interpret the solution:} Write your answer in terms of the original context of the problem.
