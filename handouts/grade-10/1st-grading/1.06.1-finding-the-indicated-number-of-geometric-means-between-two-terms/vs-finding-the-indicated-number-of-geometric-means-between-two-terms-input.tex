\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{geometric sequence} is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio \( r \).
    \item A \textbf{geometric mean} is a term that lies between two given terms in a geometric sequence.
    \item The formula to find the common ratio \( r \) when inserting \( n \) geometric means between two terms \( a \) and \( b \) is:
      
{\fontsize{11}{13}\selectfont
{\centering $  r = \sqrt[ n+1]{\dfrac{b}{a}}  $\par}
}
    \item Once \( r \) is determined, the geometric means can be found by multiplying \( a \) by increasing powers of \( r \).
\end{itemize}
