\vspace*{1ex}

To solve a system by graphing, graph each equation on the same coordinate plane. The solution to the system is the point of intersection.

\noindent\textbf{Steps for Solving a System by Graphing}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write both equations in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$).
    \item Graph both equations on the same coordinate plane.
    \item Find the point where the two lines intersect. This point is the solution to the system.
    \item Verify the solution by substituting the coordinates of the intersection point into both original equations.
\end{enumerate}
