\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{sequence} is an ordered list of numbers following a specific pattern.
    \item The \textbf{general term} (or \textbf{nth term}) of a sequence, denoted as $a_n$, provides a formula to find any term in the sequence.
    \item Sequences may contain \textbf{fractional} or \textbf{radical expressions}, requiring careful pattern recognition.
    \item The general form of a sequence depends on the observed pattern, which may involve arithmetic, geometric, or other functional relationships.
    \item To determine the nth term, analyze differences or ratios and express the pattern using algebraic expressions.
