Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
   % \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $140^\circ$ and $60^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    \item Two secants intersect outside a circle, forming an angle of $40^\circ$. If one intercepted arc measures $100^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    %\item The intercepted arcs of two secants measure $150^\circ$ and $90^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. The exterior angle measures $55^\circ$, and one intercepted arc is $140^\circ$. Find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    %\item Find the measure of the exterior angle formed by two secants intercepting arcs measuring $170^\circ$ and $110^\circ$.
    \item A secant-secant angle measures $50^\circ$. If one of the intercepted arcs is $120^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    %\item Two secants form an exterior angle of $65^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $100^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    \item The exterior angle formed by two secants is $60^\circ$. The intercepted arcs differ by $50^\circ$. Find their measures.
    %\item Two secants intersect outside a circle, creating an angle of $45^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc measures $140^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    \item The intercepted arcs of two secants measure $190^\circ$ and $120^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
