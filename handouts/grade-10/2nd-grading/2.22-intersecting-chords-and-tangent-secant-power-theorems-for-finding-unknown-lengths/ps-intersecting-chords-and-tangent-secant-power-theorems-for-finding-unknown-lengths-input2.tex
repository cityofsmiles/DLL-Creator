Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two chords intersect inside a circle. One chord is divided into segments of $6$ cm and $9$ cm. The other chord has a segment of $4$ cm. Find the other segment of the second chord.
 %   \item Chords $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ intersect at a point inside a circle. If $AP = 5$ cm, $PB = 10$ cm, and $CP = 8$ cm, find $PD$.
    \item A tangent segment is $12$ cm long. A secant from the same external point has an external part of $8$ cm and a total length of $18$ cm. Verify if the theorem holds.
    %\item A tangent measures $15$ cm, and a secant has an external part of $9$ cm. If the total length of the secant is $x$, find $x$.
    \item Two chords intersect in a circle. The segments of the first chord measure $7$ cm and $14$ cm. One segment of the second chord is $10$ cm. Find the other segment.
    %\item A secant has an external segment of $11$ cm and a total length of $22$ cm. If a tangent is drawn from the same external point, find its length.
    \item Two chords intersect at a point inside a circle. The segments of one chord measure $4$ cm and $12$ cm. The segments of the other chord are $x$ cm and $9$ cm. Solve for $x$.
    %\item A tangent to a circle measures $20$ cm. A secant has an external segment of $10$ cm and an unknown total length. Find the total length of the secant.
    \item A secant has an external segment of $7$ cm and a total length of $21$ cm. Find the length of the tangent from the same external point.
    %\item Two intersecting chords divide into segments measuring $5$ cm and $15$ cm, and $6$ cm and $x$ cm, respectively. Solve for $x$.
