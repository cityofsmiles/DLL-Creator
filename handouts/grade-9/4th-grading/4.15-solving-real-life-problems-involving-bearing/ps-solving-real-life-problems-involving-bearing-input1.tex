Solve the following problems completely.

\begin{enumerate}
    % \item A ship sails 5 km on a bearing of \(060^\circ\), then 8 km on a bearing of \(120^\circ\). Calculate the ship's final position relative to its starting point.

    % \item A plane flies 10 km on a bearing of \(030^\circ\), then 15 km on a bearing of \(150^\circ\). Find the resultant displacement of the plane.

    % \item A hiker walks 6 km on a bearing of \(045^\circ\), then 4 km on a bearing of \(135^\circ\). Determine the hiker’s final position relative to the starting point.

    % \item A ship travels 12 km on a bearing of \(090^\circ\), then 9 km on a bearing of \(180^\circ\). Calculate the distance and bearing of the ship from its starting point.

    % \item A cyclist rides 7 km on a bearing of \(300^\circ\), then 9 km on a bearing of \(045^\circ\). Find the cyclist’s resultant displacement.

    \item A plane flies 20 km on a bearing of \(240^\circ\), then 15 km on a bearing of \(315^\circ\). Calculate the plane’s position relative to the starting point.

    \item A ship sails 10 km on a bearing of \(210^\circ\), then 6 km on a bearing of \(090^\circ\). Determine the ship’s final displacement.

    \item A hiker walks 8 km on a bearing of \(330^\circ\), then 5 km on a bearing of \(030^\circ\). Calculate the hiker’s final position relative to the starting point.

    \item A plane flies 25 km on a bearing of \(120^\circ\), then 30 km on a bearing of \(240^\circ\). Find the resultant displacement of the plane.

    \item A ship sails 18 km on a bearing of \(150^\circ\), then 12 km on a bearing of \(210^\circ\). Determine the ship’s position relative to its starting point.
