Solve for the missing angle or arc measure.

\begin{enumerate}
%    \item If an inscribed angle measures $x^\circ$ and its intercepted arc is $3x + 10^\circ$, find $x$.
    \item The intercepted arc of an inscribed angle measures $4y + 20^\circ$, while the inscribed angle is $2y^\circ$. Find $y$.
   % \item Two inscribed angles intercept the same arc. If one angle is $5x - 10^\circ$ and the other is $3x + 20^\circ$, find $x$.
    \item An angle is inscribed in a semicircle. Express its measure algebraically.
    %\item The minor arc of a circle measures $x + 40^\circ$. Express the measure of the major arc in terms of $x$.
    \item A cyclic quadrilateral has opposite angles of $3y + 15^\circ$ and $5y - 5^\circ$. Find $y$.
    %\item The intercepted arc is twice the measure of an inscribed angle. If the arc is $8x - 16^\circ$, find the inscribed angle.
    \item A chord divides a circle into two arcs. The larger arc is $3x^\circ$ and the smaller arc is $(2x + 20)^\circ$. Find $x$.
   % \item The sum of two adjacent inscribed angles is $180^\circ$. If one measures $4z + 5^\circ$ and the other is $2z^\circ$, find $z$.
    \item If an intercepted arc measures $5x + 30^\circ$ and the inscribed angle that intercepts it measures $2.5x + 10^\circ$, find $x$.
\end{enumerate}
