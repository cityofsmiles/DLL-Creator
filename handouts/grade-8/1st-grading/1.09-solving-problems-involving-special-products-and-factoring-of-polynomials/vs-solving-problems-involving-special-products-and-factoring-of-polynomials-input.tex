\textbf{Lesson 1.9: Solving Problems Involving Special Products and Factoring of Polynomials}
\end{center}

\textbf{Zero Product Property:}	If the product of two factors is zero, then one or both factors must be zero.\\
			In symbols, for all real numbers $ a $ and $ b $, if $ ab = 0 $, then $ a = 0 $ or $ b = 0 $ or both $ a $ and $ b = 0 $.

\textbf{How to Solve Word Problems Involving Factors of Polynomials:}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Write an equation that represents the given information. 
		    \item Follow the rules of polynomial equation by factoring.
		    \item Check the reasonableness of answers. Discard 
solutions that do not make sense.
		    \item Interpret the results.  
		\end{enumerate}
