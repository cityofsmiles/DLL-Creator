\item Eight men can finish a job in 15 days. In how many days can 12 men finish the same job?
  
\item The surface area of a cube varies directly as the square of the length of its one edge. If the surface area of a cube is 294 cm$^2$ when the length of the edge is 7 cm, find the surface area if the length of the edge is 4 cm.

\item The frequency of an electromagnetic wave varies inversely as the wavelength. If the wavelength of 250 meters has a frequency of 640 kilocycles per second, what frequency will be associated with the wavelength of 800 meters?
  
\item The distance $d$ of a falling object varies directly as the square of the time it has been falling (neglecting air resistance). If an object falls 45 feet in 2.5 seconds, how far will the body fall from rest in 5 seconds?
