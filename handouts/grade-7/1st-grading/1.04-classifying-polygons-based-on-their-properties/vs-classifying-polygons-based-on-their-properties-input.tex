\noindent\textbf{Polygon:} a closed figure formed by three or more straight sides

\noindent  The number of sides helps determine the name of the polygon.

\noindent Polygons are classified as either regular or irregular:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A \textbf{regular} polygon has equal sides and angles.
            \item An \textbf{irregular} polygon has sides and angles of different measures.
        \end{itemize}

\noindent A polygon is classified as convex or non-convex (concave):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A \textbf{convex} polygon has all its interior angles less than 180°.
            \item A \textbf{non-convex} polygon has at least one interior angle greater than 180°.
        \end{itemize}
