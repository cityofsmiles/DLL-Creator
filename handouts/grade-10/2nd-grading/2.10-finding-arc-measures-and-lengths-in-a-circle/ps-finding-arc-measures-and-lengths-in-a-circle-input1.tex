Solve for the missing angle or arc length.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item If the central angle measures $80^\circ$, what is the measure of its intercepted arc?
    \item A circle is divided into three central angles: $x^\circ$, $2x^\circ$, and $3x^\circ$. Find $x$.
    %\item The minor arc measures $95^\circ$. Find the measure of the corresponding major arc.
    \item If the arc length is $10$ cm and the radius is $5$ cm, find the central angle in radians.
    %\item Find the length of an arc intercepted by a central angle of $60^\circ$ in a circle with a radius of $7$ cm.
    \item A semicircle is divided into two arcs. If one arc measures $x^\circ$ and the other measures $3x - 20^\circ$, find $x$.
    %\item Convert $135^\circ$ to radians.
    \item Convert $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$ radians to degrees.
    %\item The sum of two adjacent central angles is $155^\circ$. If one measures $4x + 5^\circ$ and the other measures $2x^\circ$, find $x$.
    \item If an arc measures $2\pi$ cm and the radius is $4$ cm, find the central angle in radians.
\end{enumerate}
