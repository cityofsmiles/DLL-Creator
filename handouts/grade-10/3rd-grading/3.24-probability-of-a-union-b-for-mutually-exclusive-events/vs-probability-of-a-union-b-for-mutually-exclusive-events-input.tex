\textbf{Lesson 3.24: Probability of (\(\mathbf{A \cup B}\)) for Mutually Exclusive Events}
\end{center}

When events \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive, they cannot happen at the same time. Therefore, the probability of their union is simply the sum of their probabilities:

{\centering $ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $\par}

\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P(A) \) is the probability of event \( A \)
    \item \( P(B) \) is the probability of event \( B \)
\end{itemize}
