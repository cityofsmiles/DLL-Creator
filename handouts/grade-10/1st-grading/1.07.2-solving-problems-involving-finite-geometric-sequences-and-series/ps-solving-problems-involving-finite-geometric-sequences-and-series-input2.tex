Solve the following problems involving finite geometric sequences and series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the 15th term of the geometric sequence: \(3, 9, 27, 81, \dots\)
    \item Determine the sum of the first 10 terms of the geometric sequence: \(2, 4, 8, 16, \dots\)
    \item The first term of a geometric sequence is 5, and the common ratio is 4. Find the 8th term.
    \item If the 5th term of a geometric sequence is 25 and the 8th term is 200, find the common ratio.
    \item Find the sum of the first 7 terms of the geometric sequence: \(4, 8, 16, 32, \dots\)
    \item A person deposits \$600 in a bank, and the amount quadruples each year. Find the amount after 4 years.
    \item Find the sum of the first 12 terms of the geometric sequence: \(2, 6, 18, 54, \dots\)
    \item A virus spreads at a rate of tripling its infections every day. If 50 people are infected initially, find the total infections after 7 days.
    \item The first term of a geometric sequence is \(2\), and the common ratio is \(5\). Find the 10th term.
    \item A person invests \$2000 in a fund that grows at a rate of 7\% annually. Find the total amount after 5 years.
\end{enumerate}
