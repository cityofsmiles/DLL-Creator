\noindent\textbf{Steps for Solving by Elimination}

\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*. ]
    \item Write the system of equations in standard form if needed.
    \item Multiply one or both equations by a constant to align the coefficients of one variable.
    \item Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.
    \item Solve the resulting single-variable equation.
    \item Substitute the value of the solved variable into one of the original equations to solve for the other variable.
    \item Check your solution by substituting both values into both original equations.
\end{enumerate}
