Use the Converse Triangle Proportionality Theorem to solve the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(D\) and \(E\) divide \(AB\) and \(AC\). If \(AD = 8\), \(DB = 6\), \(AE = 12\), and \(EC = 9\), is \(DE \parallel BC\)?
    \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), points \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on \(XY\) and \(XZ\), respectively. If \(XP = 6\), \(PY = 9\), \(XQ = 8\), and \(QZ = 12\), is \(PQ \parallel YZ\)?
    \item In \(\triangle DEF\), points \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(DE\) and \(DF\). If \(DM = 7\), \(ME = 9\), \(DN = 10\), and \(NF = 13\), is \(MN \parallel EF\)?
    \item In \(\triangle PQR\), points \(S\) and \(T\) lie on \(PQ\) and \(PR\), respectively. If \(PS = 5\), \(SQ = 7.5\), \(PT = 6\), and \(TR = 9\), is \(ST \parallel QR\)?
    \item In \(\triangle LMN\), points \(X\) and \(Y\) are on \(LM\) and \(LN\), respectively. If \(LX = 12\), \(XM = 4\), \(LY = 16\), and \(YN = 5\), is \(XY \parallel MN\)?
    % \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(D\) and \(E\) divide \(AB\) and \(AC\). If \(AD = 5\), \(DB = 4\), \(AE = 7.5\), and \(EC = 6\), is \(DE \parallel BC\)?
    % \item In \(\triangle PQR\), points \(S\) and \(T\) lie on \(PQ\) and \(PR\). If \(PS = 7\), \(SQ = 10.5\), \(PT = 9\), and \(TR = 13.5\), is \(ST \parallel QR\)?
    % \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(XY\) and \(XZ\). If \(XM = 6\), \(MY = 9\), \(XN = 9\), and \(NZ = 13.5\), is \(MN \parallel YZ\)?
    % \item In \(\triangle DEF\), points \(P\) and \(Q\) are on \(DE\) and \(DF\), respectively. If \(DP = 5\), \(PE = 6.5\), \(DQ = 7.5\), and \(QF = 9.75\), is \(PQ \parallel EF\)?
    % \item In \(\triangle ABC\), points \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(AB\) and \(AC\). If \(AM = 8\), \(MB = 6\), \(AN = 12\), and \(NC = 9\), is \(MN \parallel BC\)?
