Find the equation of the circle in center-radius form given the following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item Center at $(3, 4)$, passing through $(7, 4)$.
    \item Center at $(-5, 2)$, passing through $(-5, -6)$.
    %\item Endpoints of the diameter are $(6, 2)$ and $(2, -4)$.
    \item Endpoints of the diameter are $(-7, 5)$ and $(3, 5)$.
    %\item Center at $(4, -3)$, tangent to the $x$-axis.
    \item Center at $(-8, 6)$, tangent to the $y$-axis.
    %\item Center at $(1,1)$, radius of $\dfrac{7}{2}$.
    \item Center at $(7, -2)$, passing through $(3, -5)$.
    %\item The circle is centered at the origin and passes through $(5, -4)$.
    \item Center at $(8, 4)$, tangent to the line $x = 11$.
\end{enumerate}
