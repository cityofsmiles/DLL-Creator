Two radicals are said to be \textbf{similar} if they have the same index and the same radicand. Only similar radicals can be added or subtracted by applying the distributive property.

\noindent\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ensure that the radical expressions have the same index (i.e., the same root) and the same radicand.
    \item Combine the coefficients of the radical terms, keeping the radical part unchanged.
    \item Simplify the resulting expression, if possible.
\end{enumerate}
