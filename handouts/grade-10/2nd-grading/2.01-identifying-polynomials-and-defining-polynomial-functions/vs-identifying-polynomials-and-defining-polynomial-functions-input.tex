\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{polynomial} is an algebraic expression that consists of variables, coefficients, and exponents that are \textbf{non-negative integers}.
    \item A polynomial can have one or more terms, and each term is of the form $ax^n$, where \textbf{$a$ is a real number} and \textbf{$n$ is a whole number}.
    \item Expressions with variables in the denominator or with negative and fractional exponents are \textbf{not} polynomials.
    \item A \textbf{polynomial function} is a function of the form $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0$ are real numbers, and $n$ is a non-negative integer.
    \item The \textbf{degree} of a polynomial is the highest exponent of the variable.
    \item A \textbf{constant polynomial} has a degree of 0, and a \textbf{linear polynomial} has a degree of 1.
\end{itemize}
