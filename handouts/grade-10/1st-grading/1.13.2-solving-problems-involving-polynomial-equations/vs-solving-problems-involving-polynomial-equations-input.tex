\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{polynomial equation} is an equation involving a polynomial expression set equal to zero.
    \item The \textbf{degree} of a polynomial equation determines the number of possible solutions.
    \item Solutions to polynomial equations can be found using various methods such as \textbf{factoring}, the \textbf{Rational Root Theorem}, \textbf{synthetic division}, and the \textbf{quadratic formula} for degree 2 polynomials.
    \item Higher-degree polynomials may require \textbf{graphing} or \textbf{numerical methods} to approximate solutions.
\end{itemize}
