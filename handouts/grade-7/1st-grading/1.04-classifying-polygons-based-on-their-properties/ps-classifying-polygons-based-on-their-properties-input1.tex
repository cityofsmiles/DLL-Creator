Classify each polygon based on the number of sides. Then determine whether it is regular or irregular, and whether it is convex or non-convex.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A polygon with 3 sides, where all sides are equal.
    \item A polygon with 4 sides, where all sides are equal.
    \item A polygon with 5 sides, where all angles are different.
    \item A polygon with 6 sides, where the angles are all 120°.
    \item A polygon with 7 sides, where one interior angle is 200°.
    \item A polygon with 8 sides, where all sides are equal.
    \item A polygon with 3 sides, where one angle is greater than 180°.
    \item A polygon with 4 sides, where two sides are longer than the others.
    \item A polygon with 5 sides, where the sum of the interior angles is 540°.
    \item A polygon with 6 sides, where one angle is 190°.
\end{enumerate}
