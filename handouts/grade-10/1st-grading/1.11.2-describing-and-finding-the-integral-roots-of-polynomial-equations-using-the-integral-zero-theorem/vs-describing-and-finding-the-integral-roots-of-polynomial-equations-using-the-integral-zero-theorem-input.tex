\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{polynomial equation} is an equation that involves a polynomial expression.
    \item The \textbf{Integral Zero Theorem} states that if a polynomial equation with integer coefficients has an integral root, it must be a factor of the constant term.
    \item To find integral zeros, test possible values that are factors of the constant term.
    \item Synthetic division or direct substitution can be used to verify potential zeros.
    \item Identifying all integral zeros helps in fully factoring the polynomial equation.
