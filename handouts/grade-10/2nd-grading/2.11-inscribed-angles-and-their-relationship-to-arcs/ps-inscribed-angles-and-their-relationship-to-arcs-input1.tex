Solve for the missing angle or arc measure.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item If an inscribed angle measures $40^\circ$, find the measure of its intercepted arc.
    \item If an intercepted arc measures $120^\circ$, find the measure of the inscribed angle that intercepts it.
    %\item Two inscribed angles intercept the same arc. If one measures $35^\circ$, what is the measure of the other?
    \item An angle is inscribed in a semicircle. What is its measure?
    %\item An inscribed angle measures $x^\circ$ and its intercepted arc measures $3x^\circ$. Find $x$.
    \item In a cyclic quadrilateral, one angle measures $85^\circ$. Find the measure of its opposite angle.
    %\item An inscribed angle intercepts an arc that is $150^\circ$. Find the measure of the angle.
    \item A chord divides a circle into two arcs. The larger arc measures $260^\circ$. Find the measure of the smaller arc.
    %\item The sum of two adjacent inscribed angles is $125^\circ$. If one measures $4y + 5^\circ$ and the other is $2y^\circ$, find $y$.
    \item If an intercepted arc measures $4x + 20^\circ$ and the inscribed angle that intercepts it measures $2x + 10^\circ$, find $x$.
\end{enumerate}
