\textbf{Lesson 1.8.3: Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials}
\end{center}

\vspace*{-0.5ex}

\textbf{Perfect Square Trinomial:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item the result of squaring a binomial
\item has first and last terms which are perfect squares and a middle term which is twice the product of the square root of the first and last terms
\end{itemize}
 
\textbf{Steps in Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials:}

\begin{enumerate}
    		\item Factor out the greatest common monomial of all terms of the given expression.
\item Get the square root of the first and last terms. 
\item List down the square root as sum or difference of two terms as the case may be.
\end{enumerate}

$$\displaystyle a^{2} - 2ab + b^{2} = (a - b)^{2}$$
