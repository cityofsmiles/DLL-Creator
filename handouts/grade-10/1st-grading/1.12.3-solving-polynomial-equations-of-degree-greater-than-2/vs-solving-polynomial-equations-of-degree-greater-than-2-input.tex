\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{polynomial equation} is an equation in which a polynomial expression is set equal to zero.
    \item The \textbf{degree} of a polynomial equation is the highest power of the variable.
    \item To solve a polynomial equation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the \textbf{Rational Root Theorem} to list possible rational roots.
        \item Apply \textbf{synthetic division} or \textbf{polynomial division} to simplify the polynomial.
        \item Factorize the polynomial completely if possible.
        \item Use the \textbf{Quadratic Formula} or other algebraic methods to find remaining roots.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A polynomial equation may have \textbf{real, irrational, or complex roots}.
\end{itemize}
