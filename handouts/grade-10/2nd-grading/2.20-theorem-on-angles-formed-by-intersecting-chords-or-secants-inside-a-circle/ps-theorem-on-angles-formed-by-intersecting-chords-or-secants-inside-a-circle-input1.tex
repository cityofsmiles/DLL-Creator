Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Two chords intersect inside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $120^\circ$ and $80^\circ$. Find the measure of the interior angle.
    \item Two secants intersect inside a circle. The angle formed measures $80^\circ$. If one intercepted arc is $110^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
   % \item The intercepted arcs of two chords measure $150^\circ$ and $100^\circ$. Find the measure of the interior angle.
    \item Two secants intersect inside a circle. The interior angle measures $70^\circ$, and one intercepted arc is $90^\circ$. Find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    %\item Find the measure of the interior angle formed by two chords intercepting arcs measuring $170^\circ$ and $110^\circ$.
    \item A chord-chord angle measures $80^\circ$. If one of the intercepted arcs is $140^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    %\item Two chords form an interior angle of $100^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $120^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    \item The interior angle formed by two chords is $85^\circ$. The intercepted arcs differ by $50^\circ$. Find their measures.
    %\item Two secants intersect inside a circle, creating an angle of $82^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc measures $160^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    \item The intercepted arcs of two chords measure $210^\circ$ and $150^\circ$. Find the measure of the interior angle.
