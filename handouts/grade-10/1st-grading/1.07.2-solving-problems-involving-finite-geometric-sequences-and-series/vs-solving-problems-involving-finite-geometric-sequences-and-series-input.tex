\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{geometric sequence} is a sequence in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the \textbf{common ratio} (\(r\)).
    % \item The \textbf{nth term} of a geometric sequence is given by:
    %       \[ a_n = a_1 r^{(n-1)} \]
    %       where:
    %       \begin{itemize}
    %           \item \( a_n \) is the nth term,
    %           \item \( a_1 \) is the first term, and
    %           \item \( r \) is the common ratio.
    %       \end{itemize}
    % \item The \textbf{sum} of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence (geometric series) is given by:
    %       \[ S_n = a_1 \dfrac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}, \quad r \neq 1 \]
    \item Geometric sequences and series are used in solving real-life problems, such as population growth, investments, and physics applications.
