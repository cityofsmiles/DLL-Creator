%\vspace*{1ex}

\textbf{Completing the Square}: involves transforming the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ into the form $(x - h)^2 = k$, where $k \geq 0$.  The value of k should be positive to obtain a real number solution.

\textbf{How to Solve the Quadratic Equation $\boldsymbol{ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$ by Completing the Square:}

\begin{enumerate}[label = \color{blue}\arabic*. ]
%1
   \item Divide both sides of the equation by $a$ then simplify.
%2
   \item Write the equation such that the terms with variables are on the left side of the equation and the constant term is on the right side.
%3
   \item Add the square of one-half of the coefficient of x on both sides of the resulting equation.
%4
   \item Express the perfect square trinomial on the left side of the equation as a square of a binomial.
%5
   \item Solve the resulting quadratic equation by extracting the square root.
%6
   \item Solve the resulting linear equations.
%7
   \item Check the solutions obtained against the original equation.
