Use the formula \(P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\) to solve the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item Find the number of ways to arrange 5 objects taken 3 at a time.
    \item How many distinct permutations can be made from 7 objects taken 4 at a time?
    \item Calculate \(P(6, 2)\).
    \item How many ways can 8 objects be arranged taken 5 at a time?
    \item If \(n = 9\) and \(r = 3\), find \(P(n, r)\).
    \item Determine the number of permutations of 10 objects taken 6 at a time.
    \item Solve for \(P(12, 8)\).
    \item Find the number of distinct arrangements of 5 objects taken 2 at a time.
    \item If \(n = 11\) and \(r = 7\), compute \(P(n, r)\).
    \item Calculate \(P(15, 10)\).
\end{enumerate}
