\begin{enumerate}
    \item A person standing 50 meters away from a building observes its top with an angle of elevation of \(30^\circ\). Find the height of the building.
    \item A kite is flying at an angle of elevation of \(40^\circ\) and is 100 meters away from its handler. Find the altitude of the kite.
    \item From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of a 20-meter pole is \(45^\circ\). Find the distance from the point to the base of the pole.
    \item A ramp is inclined at \(25^\circ\) and is 5 meters long. Find the height the ramp rises to.
    \item An observer spots a bird at an angle of elevation of \(60^\circ\). If the bird is 30 meters above the ground, find the horizontal distance to the bird.
    % \item A tree casts a shadow 12 meters long, and the angle of elevation of the sun is \(50^\circ\). Find the height of the tree.
    % \item A drone is observed at an angle of elevation of \(15^\circ\) and is 80 meters horizontally from the observer. Find the altitude of the drone.
    % \item A man standing 30 meters away from a tower observes its top at an angle of elevation of \(35^\circ\). Find the height of the tower.
    % \item A ladder leans against a wall, forming an angle of elevation of \(65^\circ\) with the ground. The ladder is 6 meters long. Find how high it reaches on the wall.
    % \item A person looks at the top of a hill with an angle of elevation of \(20^\circ\). If the person is standing 150 meters away from the hill's base, find the height of the hill.
