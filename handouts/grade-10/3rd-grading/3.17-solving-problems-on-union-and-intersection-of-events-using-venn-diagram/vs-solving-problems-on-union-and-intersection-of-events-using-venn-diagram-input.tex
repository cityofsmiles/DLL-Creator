\noindent\textbf{Step-by-Step Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the events involved in the problem.
    \item Draw the Venn diagram with the given sets and label the universal set if needed.
    \item Represent the union (\(A \cup B\)) or intersection (\(A \cap B\)) of events in the Venn diagram.
    \item Use the diagram to solve the problem.
    \item For compound events, find the union or intersection by considering all outcomes in the Venn diagram.
\end{enumerate}
