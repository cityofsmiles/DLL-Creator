\noindent\textbf{Converse Triangle Proportionality Theorem}: If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side.

\noindent\textbf{Steps for Solving Problems Using the Converse Triangle Proportionality Theorem}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identify Given Segments:} Write down the segment lengths given in the problem.
    \item \textbf{Set Up a Proportion:} Use the ratios of the segments to test proportionality.
    \item \textbf{Verify Parallelism:} Solve the proportion and confirm if the ratios are equal. If they are, the line is parallel to the third side.
    \item \textbf{State the Conclusion:} Conclude whether the given line is parallel to the side based on the proportion.
\end{enumerate}
