In \textbf{Stratified Sampling}, the population is divided into distinct groups, or strata, based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, or grade level). A random sample is then selected from each stratum. This technique ensures representation from each group.

In \textbf{Cluster Sampling}, the population is divided into clusters, typically based on geographic or organizational groups. Entire clusters are then randomly selected, and all members of the chosen clusters are included in the sample.
