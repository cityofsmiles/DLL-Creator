\textbf{Polyhedron:} a solid figure usually with more than six faces

\textbf{Pyramid:} a polyhedron with a polygonal base and triangular lateral faces that meet at a common vertex called the \textbf{apex}

\textbf{Square Pyramid:} a pyramid with a square base

\textbf{Rectangular Pyramid:} a pyramid with a rectangular base

\textbf{Rectangular Prism:} a polyhedron with two congruent and parallel bases, and has 6 rectangular faces and 12 edges

The volume of a pyramid is \(\dfrac{1}{3}\) of the volume of a prism with the same base and height. Therefore,

{\centering $ V_{\text{Pyramid}} = \dfrac{1}{3}V_{\text{Prism}} \text{ and } V_{\text{Prism}} = 3 V_{\text{Pyramid}}  $\par}
