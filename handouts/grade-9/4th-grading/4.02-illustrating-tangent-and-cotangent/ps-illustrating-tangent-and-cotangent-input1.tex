Solve the following problems. Write your answers in simplest fractional form where applicable.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a right triangle, the opposite side is 6 units, and the adjacent side is 8 units. Find $\tan A$.
    \item In a right triangle, the opposite side is 9 units, and the adjacent side is 12 units. Find $\tan B$.
    \item In a right triangle, $\tan C = \dfrac{3}{4}$. If the opposite side is 6 units, find the adjacent side.
%    \item In a right triangle, $\cot D = \dfrac{5}{12}$. If the adjacent side is 10 units, find the opposite side.
    \item In a right triangle, the opposite side is 7 units, and the adjacent side is 24 units. Find $\cot E$.
   % \item A right triangle has $\tan F = \dfrac{5}{3}$. If the opposite side is 15 units, find the adjacent side.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\cot G = \dfrac{8}{6}$. If the adjacent side is 16 units, find the opposite side.
    \item A right triangle has an opposite side of 12 units and an adjacent side of 5 units. Find $\tan H$.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\tan J = \dfrac{4}{3}$. If the opposite side is 20 units, find the adjacent side.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\cot K = \dfrac{7}{24}$. If the adjacent side is 21 units, find the opposite side.
