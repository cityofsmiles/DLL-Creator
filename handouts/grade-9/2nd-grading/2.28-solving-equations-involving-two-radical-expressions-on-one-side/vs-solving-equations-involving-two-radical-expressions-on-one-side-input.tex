\noindent Follow these steps to solve equations involving two radicals on one side:
%\begin{multicols}{2}
\setlist{nolistsep}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label = \color{blue}\arabic*. ]
    \item Isolate one of the radicals     
    \item Square both sides of the equation 
    \item Simplify the resulting equation  
    \item Isolate the remaining radical  
    \item Square both sides again  
    \item Solve the resulting polynomial equation  
\end{enumerate}
