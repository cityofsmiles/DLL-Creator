\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{geometric sequence} is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio \( r \).
    \item The general term (or \textbf{nth term}) of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:

{\centering $  a_n = a_1 r^{(n-1)}  $\par}
      %\[ a_n = a_1 r^{(n-1)} \]
          where:
          \begin{itemize}
            \begin{multicols}{2}
              \item \( a_n \) is the nth term,
              \item \( a_1 \) is the first term,
              \item \( r \) is the common ratio, and
              \item \( n \) is the term number.
                \end{multicols}
          \end{itemize}
    \item The formula allows us to find any term in the sequence without listing all the previous terms.
\end{itemize}
