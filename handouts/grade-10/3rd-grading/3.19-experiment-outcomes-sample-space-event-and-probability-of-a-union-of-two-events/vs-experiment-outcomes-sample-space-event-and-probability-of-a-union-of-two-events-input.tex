\noindent\textbf{Key Concepts}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Experiment:} An action or procedure that produces a set of outcomes.
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} A possible result of an experiment.
    \item \textbf{Sample Space (\(S\)):} The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
    \item \textbf{Event:} A specific outcome or set of outcomes from an experiment.
    \item \textbf{Probability of a Union of Two Events:} If \(A\) and \(B\) are two events, the probability of the union of these two events is given by:

{\centering $ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $\par}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Step-by-Step Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the experiment being performed and list the possible outcomes.
    \item Define the sample space, which includes all possible outcomes of the experiment.
    \item Identify the events \(A\) and \(B\) involved in the experiment.
 %   \item Use the formula for the probability of a union of two events: 
    % \[
    % P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
    % \]
    \item Calculate the probability of the union of the two events using the formula.
\end{enumerate}
