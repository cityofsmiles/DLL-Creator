\noindent\textbf{Triangle Proportionality Theorem}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item If a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, it divides those sides proportionally.
    \item Conversely, if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, it is parallel to the third side.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Steps for Solving Problems Using the Triangle Proportionality Theorem}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identify the Proportional Relationship:} Determine the pairs of corresponding segments that are proportional due to the parallel line.
    \item \textbf{Set Up a Proportion:} Write an equation that sets the ratios of the segments equal to each other.
    \item \textbf{Solve for the Unknown:} Use algebra to solve for the missing length or verify the proportionality.
    \item \textbf{Verify the Solution:} Check that your answer satisfies the conditions of the theorem.
\end{enumerate}
