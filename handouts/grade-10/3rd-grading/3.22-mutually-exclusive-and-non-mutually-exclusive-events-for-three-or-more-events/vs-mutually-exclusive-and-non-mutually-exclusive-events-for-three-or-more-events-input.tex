\noindent\textbf{Mutually Exclusive Events:} Three or more events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. That is, no two events share common outcomes.

\noindent \textbf{Non-Mutually Exclusive Events:} Three or more events are non-mutually exclusive if they can occur at the same time, meaning at least two events share some outcomes.


\noindent\textbf{Step-by-Step Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the events involved in the problem.
    \item Check whether the events can happen simultaneously (i.e., whether they share common outcomes).
    \item If the events cannot happen at the same time, they are mutually exclusive.
    \item If the events can happen at the same time, they are non-mutually exclusive.
\end{enumerate}
