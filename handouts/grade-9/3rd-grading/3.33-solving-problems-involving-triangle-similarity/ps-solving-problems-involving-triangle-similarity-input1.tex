Solve the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$, $AB = 6$ cm, $AC = 8$ cm, and $DE = 9$ cm. Find $DF$.
    \item In $\triangle XYZ \sim \triangle PQR$, $XY = 5$ cm, $XZ = 12$ cm, and $PQ = 10$ cm. Find $PR$.
    \item Two triangles are similar, and their side lengths are in the ratio $3:5$. If the shortest side of the smaller triangle is $9$ cm, find the length of the corresponding side in the larger triangle.
    \item In $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$, $\angle A = 40^\circ$, $\angle B = 60^\circ$. Find $\angle E$ and $\angle F$.
    \item A flagpole casts a shadow of $10$ m, while a nearby tree casts a shadow of $4$ m. If the tree is $3$ m tall, how tall is the flagpole?
    % \item In $\triangle LMN \sim \triangle OPQ$, $LM = 7$ cm, $MN = 10$ cm, and $OP = 14$ cm. Find $OQ$.
    % \item In two similar triangles, the ratio of their areas is $1:4$. If the perimeter of the smaller triangle is $15$ cm, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?
    % \item In $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle XYZ$, $BC = 15$ cm, $AB = 9$ cm, and $XY = 6$ cm. Find $YZ$.
    % \item Two triangles are similar, and their corresponding heights are $4$ cm and $10$ cm. If the area of the smaller triangle is $20$ cm$^2$, find the area of the larger triangle.
    % \item A ladder $12$ m long leans against a wall, casting a shadow of $5$ m. A 3-m stick nearby casts a shadow of $1.25$ m. Are the ladder and the stick proportionally similar? Justify your answer.
