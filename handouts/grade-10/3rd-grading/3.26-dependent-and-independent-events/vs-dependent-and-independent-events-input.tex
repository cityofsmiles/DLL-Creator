\noindent \textbf{Independent Events:} Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \).

\noindent \textbf{Dependent Events:} Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other. For dependent events, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) \), where \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of \( B \) given \( A \).
