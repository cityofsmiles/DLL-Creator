Solve the following problems completely. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A person is standing on a 50-meter-high tower. The angle of depression to a car parked on the ground is \(30^\circ\). Find the distance of the car from the base of the tower.

    \item From the top of a lighthouse, 80 meters above sea level, the angle of depression to a boat is \(45^\circ\). How far is the boat from the base of the lighthouse?

    \item A bird is perched on a tree 25 meters high. The angle of depression to a fish in a pond is \(60^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance between the bird and the fish.

    \item A firefighter on a ladder 30 meters above the ground sees a fire on the ground at an angle of depression of \(40^\circ\). Find the distance from the ladder to the fire.

    \item A person on a cliff observes a ship at an angle of depression of \(20^\circ\). If the height of the cliff is 100 meters, find the horizontal distance between the person and the ship.

    % \item A drone is flying 150 meters above the ground. The angle of depression to a target on the ground is \(35^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the target.

    % \item From the top of a hill, 200 meters above the ground, the angle of depression to a house is \(25^\circ\). Calculate the horizontal distance to the house.

    % \item A skier is standing on a hill 60 meters tall. The angle of depression to the base of the hill is \(38^\circ\). Find the length of the slope.

    % \item A pilot flying at an altitude of 1200 meters sees the runway at an angle of depression of \(15^\circ\). How far is the plane horizontally from the runway?

    % \item From the top of a tower 90 meters high, the angle of depression to a car is \(28^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance from the tower to the car.
