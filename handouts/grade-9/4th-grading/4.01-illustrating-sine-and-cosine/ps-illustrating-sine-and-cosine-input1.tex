Solve the following problems. Write your answers in simplest fractional form where applicable.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 10 units, and the side opposite angle $A$ is 6 units. Find $\sin A$.
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 13 units, and the side adjacent to angle $B$ is 5 units. Find $\cos B$.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\sin C = \dfrac{3}{5}$. If the hypotenuse is 10 units, find the length of the side opposite angle $C$.
    \item In a right triangle, $\cos D = \dfrac{12}{13}$. If the adjacent side is 12 units, find the hypotenuse.
    %\item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 15 units, and the side adjacent to angle $E$ is 9 units. Find $\cos E$.
    \item A right triangle has $\sin F = \dfrac{7}{25}$. If the hypotenuse is 25 units, find the opposite side.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\cos G = \dfrac{4}{5}$. If the hypotenuse is 20 units, find the length of the adjacent side.
    %\item A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 17 units and an adjacent side of 15 units to angle $H$. Find $\cos H$.
 %   \item In a right triangle, $\sin J = \dfrac{8}{17}$. If the hypotenuse is 34 units, find the side opposite angle $J$.
    \item In a right triangle, $\cos K = \dfrac{9}{10}$. If the adjacent side is 9 units, find the hypotenuse.
 \end{enumerate}
