\begin{enumerate}[label = \color{blue}\arabic*. ]
%1
   \item Transform the quadratic equation into standard form if necessary.
%2
   \item Factor the quadratic expression.
%3
   \item Apply the zero product property by setting each factor of the quadratic expression equal to 0.
%4
   \item Solve each resulting equation to get the value of the variable.
%5
   \item Check the values of the variable obtained by substituting each in the original equation.
