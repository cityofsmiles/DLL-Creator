Solve the following real-life problems.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A flagpole casts a shadow 15 m long. The angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is \(30^\circ\), and the distance from the base of the pole to the shadow's tip is 20 m. Find the height of the flagpole.
    \item A ship is anchored 50 km from a lighthouse. The angle from the lighthouse to the ship is \(40^\circ\), and the ship is 60 km away from another lighthouse in the same direction. Determine the possible locations of the ship.
    \item A tree is 20 m tall, and the angle of elevation to its top is \(45^\circ\). A bird flies 30 m away from the tree at an angle of \(50^\circ\). Find the possible heights of the bird above the ground.
    \item A plane is flying at an altitude of 1,000 m. From an observer on the ground, the angle of elevation to the plane is \(35^\circ\), and the horizontal distance to the plane is 1,500 m. Find the possible distances from the observer to the plane.
    \item A triangular field has a side of 200 m, with an angle of \(50^\circ\) opposite another side measuring 150 m. Find the possible lengths of the third side.
    % \item A lighthouse beam forms angles of \(60^\circ\) and \(70^\circ\) with two ships. The first ship is 50 km away from the lighthouse, and the second ship is 80 km away. Find the possible distances between the ships.
    % \item A tree is 15 m tall. A point 10 m away forms a shadow angle of \(45^\circ\), and the same shadow point forms another angle of \(30^\circ\) with the tree top. Determine the possible heights of the tree's shadow.
    % \item Two airplanes form angles of \(40^\circ\) and \(50^\circ\) with an air traffic control tower. The planes are 5 km apart, and the closer plane is 3 km from the tower. Find the possible distances of the second plane from the tower.
    % \item A cyclist travels 10 km west, then turns and travels at an angle of \(60^\circ\) to the original direction for 15 km. Find the possible locations of the cyclist.
    % \item A hot air balloon is 500 m above the ground. The angles of elevation to the balloon from two points 300 m apart on the ground are \(30^\circ\) and \(40^\circ\). Find the possible locations of the balloon.
