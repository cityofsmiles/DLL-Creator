\vspace*{1ex}

\textbf{Quadratic Equations} that can be written in the form $x^2 = r$, where $r$ could be any real number, can be solved by the method called \textbf{Extracting Square Roots}. A quadratic equation can have two or only one real solution(s). In some cases, it can also have no real solutions.

\textbf{Properties of Extracting Square Roots}:

\begin{enumerate}[label = \color{blue}\arabic*. ]
%1
   \item If $r > 0$, then $x^2 = r$ has two real solutions or roots: $x = \pm\sqrt{r} $. 
%2
   \item If $r = 0$, then $x^2 = r$ has one real solution or root: $x = 0$.
%3
   \item If $r < 0$, then $x^2 = r$ has no real solutions or roots.
