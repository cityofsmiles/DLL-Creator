%    \item In a litter of kittens, 3 have black fur, and 5 have white fur. What is the probability that a randomly selected kitten has black fur?
    \item A pea plant carries one dominant allele (A) and one recessive allele (a). What is the probability of passing the dominant allele to offspring?
   % \item A biologist is studying a population of 30 frogs, and 12 of them have a rare genetic mutation. What is the probability that a randomly caught frog has this mutation?
    \item In a garden, there are 6 red flowers, 8 yellow flowers, and 10 white flowers. What is the probability of randomly selecting a yellow flower?
    %\item A human has two alleles for eye color: B (brown) and b (blue). If a parent has genotype Bb, what is the probability that the child inherits the recessive allele (b)?
    \item A researcher finds that 40\% of a bacterial colony carries a resistance gene. What is the probability that a randomly selected bacterium does not carry the gene?
    %\item In a group of 50 birds, 15 are carriers of a particular disease. What is the probability that a randomly selected bird is not a carrier?
    \item A geneticist studies a sample of 20 fruit flies. If 7 exhibit a specific wing mutation, what is the probability of selecting a mutated fruit fly?
    %\item A school experiment finds that 4 out of 25 plants exposed to a pollutant show signs of damage. What is the probability that a randomly selected plant is unaffected?
    \item A species of fish has a 25\% chance of carrying a specific genetic marker. What is the probability that a randomly selected fish does not carry the marker?
