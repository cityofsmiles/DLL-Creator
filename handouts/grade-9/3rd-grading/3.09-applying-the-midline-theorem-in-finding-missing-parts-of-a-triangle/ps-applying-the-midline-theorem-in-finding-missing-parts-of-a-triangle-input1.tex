Use the Midline Theorem to find the missing lengths in each of the following triangles.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In \(\bigtriangleup ABC\), \(D\) and \(E\) are the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AC\), respectively. If \(BC = 20\), find \(DE\).
    \item In \(\bigtriangleup XYZ\), \(P\) and \(Q\) are midpoints of \(XY\) and \(XZ\). If \(PQ = 7\), find \(YZ\).
    \item In \(\bigtriangleup DEF\), \(G\) and \(H\) are midpoints of \(DE\) and \(DF\). If \(GH = 12\), find \(EF\).
    \item In \(\bigtriangleup PQR\), \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints of \(PQ\) and \(PR\). If \(QR = 9\), find \(ST\).
    \item In \(\bigtriangleup JKL\), \(M\) and \(N\) are midpoints of \(JK\) and \(JL\). If \(KL = 8\), find \(MN\).
%    \item In \(\bigtriangleup ABC\), \(D\) and \(E\) are midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AC\). If \(DE = 6\), find \(BC\).
 %   \item In \(\bigtriangleup UVW\), \(X\) and \(Y\) are midpoints of \(UV\) and \(UW\). If \(XY = 15\), find \(VW\).
  %  \item In \(\bigtriangleup RST\), \(U\) and \(V\) are midpoints of \(RS\) and \(RT\). If \(UV = 10\), find \(ST\).
   % \item In \(\bigtriangleup MNP\), \(Q\) and \(R\) are midpoints of \(MN\) and \(MP\). If \(QR = 5\), find \(NP\).
    %\item In \(\bigtriangleup FGH\), \(I\) and \(J\) are midpoints of \(FG\) and \(FH\). If \(IJ = 11\), find \(GH\).
\end{enumerate}
