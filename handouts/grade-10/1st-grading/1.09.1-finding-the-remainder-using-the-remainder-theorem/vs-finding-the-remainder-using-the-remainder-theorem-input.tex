\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Remainder Theorem} states that the remainder when a polynomial \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x - c \) is equal to \( f(c) \).
    \item To find the remainder, substitute \( c \) into the polynomial and evaluate \( f(c) \).
    \item If the remainder is zero, then \( x - c \) is a factor of the polynomial.
\end{itemize}
