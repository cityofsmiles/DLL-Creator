\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{distance formula} is used to find the distance between two points on the coordinate plane.
    \item The formula is derived from the \textbf{Pythagorean Theorem}, which states that in a right triangle:
    \[
    c^2 = a^2 + b^2
    \]
    where $c$ is the hypotenuse, and $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the triangle.
    \item If two points are given as $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$, the distance $d$ between them is:
    \[
    d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
    \]
    \item This formula is useful in geometry, physics, and real-world applications such as navigation and map reading.
\end{itemize}
