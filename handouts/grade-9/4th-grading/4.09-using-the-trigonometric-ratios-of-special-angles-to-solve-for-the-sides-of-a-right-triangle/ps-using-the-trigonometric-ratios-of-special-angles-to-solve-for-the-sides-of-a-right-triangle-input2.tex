\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a right triangle, one angle is \(60^\circ\) and the hypotenuse is 12 units. Find the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides.
  %  \item In a right triangle, one angle is \(45^\circ\) and the hypotenuse is 14 units. Find the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides.
    \item A right triangle has a \(30^\circ\) angle, and the adjacent side is 6 units. Find the hypotenuse and opposite side.
    \item A right triangle has a \(60^\circ\) angle, and the opposite side is 7 units. Find the hypotenuse and adjacent side.
    \item A triangle has a \(45^\circ\) angle, and the opposite side is 9 units. Find the hypotenuse and adjacent side.
  %  \item In a right triangle, one angle is \(30^\circ\) and the hypotenuse is 18 units. Find the opposite and adjacent sides.
    \item A triangle has a \(60^\circ\) angle, and the adjacent side is 5 units. Find the hypotenuse and opposite side.
    % \item A triangle has a \(45^\circ\) angle, and the hypotenuse is \(8\sqrt{2}\) units. Find the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides.
    % \item In a right triangle, one angle is \(30^\circ\) and the opposite side is \(4\sqrt{3}\) units. Find the hypotenuse and adjacent side.
