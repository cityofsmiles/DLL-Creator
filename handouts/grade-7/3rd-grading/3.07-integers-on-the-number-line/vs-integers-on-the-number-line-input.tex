\noindent Integers can be located on a number line, with negative integers positioned to the left of zero and positive integers positioned to the right of zero. The further left you go, the smaller the value, and the further right you go, the larger the value.

\noindent\textbf{Tips for Locating Integers on the Number Line:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start at zero and move right for positive integers and left for negative integers.
    \item Count each space as one unit to the left or right.
    \item Verify each integerâ€™s position by counting spaces from zero.
\end{itemize}
