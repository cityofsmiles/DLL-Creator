\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{geometric sequence} is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio \( r \).
    \item A \textbf{finite geometric sequence} has a limited number of terms.
    \item An \textbf{infinite geometric sequence} continues indefinitely without an ending term.
    \item If \( |r| < 1 \), an infinite geometric sequence has a sum; otherwise, it diverges.
\end{itemize}
