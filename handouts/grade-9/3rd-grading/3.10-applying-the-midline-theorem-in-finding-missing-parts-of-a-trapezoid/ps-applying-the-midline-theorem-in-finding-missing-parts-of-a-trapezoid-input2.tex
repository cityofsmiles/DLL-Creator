Use the Midline Theorem to find the missing lengths in each of the following trapezoids.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In trapezoid \(ABCD\), with bases \(AB = 14\) and \(CD = 26\), the midline \(EF\) joins the midpoints of \(AD\) and \(BC\). Find \(EF\).
    \item In trapezoid \(PQRS\), \(PQ = 20\) and \(MN = 27\). The midline \(MN\) joins the midpoints of \(PS\) and \(QR\). Find \(RS\).
    \item In trapezoid \(WXYZ\), with bases \(WX = 12\) and \(YZ = 32\), the midline \(UV\) joins the midpoints of \(WZ\) and \(XY\). Find \(UV\).
    \item In trapezoid \(LMNO\), \(JK = 15\) and \(NO = 21\), and midline \(JK\) connects the midpoints of \(LO\) and \(MN\). Find \(LM\).
    \item In trapezoid \(EFGH\), where \(EF = 17\) and \(GH = 31\), the midline \(IJ\) joins the midpoints of \(EH\) and \(FG\). Find \(IJ\).
    \item In trapezoid \(QRST\), with \(QR = 15\) and \(UV = 25\), the midline \(UV\) joins the midpoints of \(QT\) and \(RS\). Find \(ST\).
    \item In trapezoid \(ABCD\), \(AB = 19\) and \(CD = 37\), and the midline \(XY\) joins the midpoints of \(AD\) and \(BC\). Find \(XY\).
    \item In trapezoid \(WXYZ\), \(LM = 17\) and \(YZ = 23\), the midline \(LM\) connects the midpoints of \(WZ\) and \(XY\). Find \(WZ\).
    \item In trapezoid \(JKLM\), where \(JK = 8\) and \(LM = 30\), the midline \(PQ\) joins the midpoints of \(JM\) and \(KL\). Find \(PQ\).
    \item In trapezoid \(OPQR\), \(OP = 7\) and \(ST = 16\), and the midline \(ST\) joins the midpoints of \(OR\) and \(PQ\). Find \(QR\).
