Solve each problem completely.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A person looks at the top of a 15-meter building with an angle of elevation of \(40^\circ\). Find the distance from the person to the base of the building.
    \item A 10-meter ladder leans against a wall, forming an angle of elevation of \(50^\circ\) with the ground. Find how high the ladder reaches on the wall.
   % \item A hill has an angle of elevation of \(20^\circ\), and a cyclist rides 80 meters up the hill. How high does the cyclist ascend vertically?
    \item A kite is flying at an angle of elevation of \(30^\circ\) from an observer and is 70 meters away horizontally. Find the altitude of the kite.
  %  \item From a boat, the angle of elevation to the top of a tower is \(25^\circ\). The boat is 50 meters away from the tower. Find the height of the tower.
    % \item A ramp is built at an angle of elevation of \(35^\circ\) and has a length of 6 meters. Find the height it rises to.
    % \item A tree casts a shadow 12 meters long, and the angle of elevation of the sun is \(30^\circ\). Find the height of the tree.
    % \item A plane ascends at an angle of \(15^\circ\) and has traveled 300 meters along its path. Find its vertical ascent.
    \item A camera is set at an angle of elevation of \(60^\circ\) to capture the top of a tower 25 meters away. Find the height of the tower.
    \item A streetlight casts a shadow 10 meters long, and the angle of elevation of the light is \(65^\circ\). Find the height of the streetlight.
