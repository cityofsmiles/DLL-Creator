Solve the following word problems using the distance formula and equation of a circle.

\begin{enumerate}
%    \item A point $P(4,5)$ lies on a circle centered at $C(1,2)$. Find the equation of the circle.
    \item Find the radius of a circle if its center is at $(-3,4)$ and it passes through the point $(2,8)$.
 %   \item Determine whether the point $(6,-1)$ is inside, outside, or on the circle given by the equation $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25$.
    \item A circular garden has its center at $(5,7)$ and passes through the point $(9,10)$. What is the area of the garden?
  %  \item A drone is flying over a city. The base station is at $(0,0)$, and the drone can travel up to a maximum distance of $10$ units. Write the equation of the circular region that the drone can cover.
    \item Two points $A(-2,1)$ and $B(4,5)$ are endpoints of a diameter of a circle. Find the equation of the circle.
  %  \item A security camera at $(1,3)$ has a detection range of $8$ meters. Write the equation of the boundary it covers.
    \item A park has a circular fountain centered at $(7,-2)$ with a radius of $6$ meters. A visitor is standing at $(2,3)$. Is the visitor inside or outside the fountainâ€™s boundary?
  %  \item The equation of a circle is $x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 8y - 11 = 0$. Find the center and radius of the circle.
    \item A cellphone tower is placed at $(4,-3)$. It has a signal range of $12$ km. What is the equation of the circular coverage area?
