Use the Venn diagram to represent the sets and solve the problems.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In a group of 25 students, 15 take Math, 18 take English, and 10 take both Math and English. How many students take either Math or English?
    \item Let \( A = \{3, 6, 9, 12\} \) and \( B = \{1, 2, 3, 5\} \). Find \( A \cup B \).
    \item In a class of 40 students, 20 are enrolled in Biology, 18 are enrolled in Chemistry, and 12 are enrolled in both. How many students are enrolled in either Biology or Chemistry?
    \item Let \( X = \{4, 8, 12, 16\} \) and \( Y = \{1, 3, 6, 9, 12\} \). Find \( X \cap Y \).
    \item A survey showed that 50 students like Pizza, 60 students like Burgers, and 25 students like both Pizza and Burgers. How many students like either Pizza or Burgers?
    \item Let \( A = \{2, 4, 6, 8\} \) and \( B = \{4, 6, 8, 10\} \). Find \( A - B \).
    \item In a class of 30 students, 12 like hockey, 14 like tennis, and 6 like both. How many students like neither hockey nor tennis?
    \item Let \( A = \{2, 4, 6, 8\} \), \( B = \{6, 8, 10, 12\} \), and \( C = \{8, 12, 14\} \). Find \( A \cup B \cup C \).
    \item In a survey, 150 people were asked if they liked Dogs or Birds. 90 like Dogs, 80 like Birds, and 50 like both. How many people like either Dogs or Birds?
    \item Let \( A = \{x, y, z\} \), \( B = \{y, z, w\} \), and \( C = \{z, x, y\} \). Find \( A \cup (B \cap C) \).
