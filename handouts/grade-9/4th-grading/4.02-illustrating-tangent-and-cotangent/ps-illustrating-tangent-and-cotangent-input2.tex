Solve the following problems. Write your answers in simplest fractional form where applicable.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a right triangle, the opposite side is 5 units, and the adjacent side is 9 units. Find $\tan P$.
    \item In a right triangle, the opposite side is 8 units, and the adjacent side is 15 units. Find $\tan Q$.
%    \item In a right triangle, $\tan R = \dfrac{2}{5}$. If the opposite side is 4 units, find the adjacent side.
   % \item In a right triangle, $\cot S = \dfrac{4}{9}$. If the adjacent side is 8 units, find the opposite side.
    \item In a right triangle, the opposite side is 10 units, and the adjacent side is 18 units. Find $\cot T$.
    %\item A right triangle has $\tan U = \dfrac{7}{5}$. If the opposite side is 21 units, find the adjacent side.
    \item In a right triangle, $\cot V = \dfrac{9}{8}$. If the adjacent side is 27 units, find the opposite side.
    \item A right triangle has an opposite side of 15 units and an adjacent side of 7 units. Find $\tan W$.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\tan X = \dfrac{3}{2}$. If the opposite side is 18 units, find the adjacent side.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\cot Y = \dfrac{5}{12}$. If the adjacent side is 25 units, find the opposite side.
