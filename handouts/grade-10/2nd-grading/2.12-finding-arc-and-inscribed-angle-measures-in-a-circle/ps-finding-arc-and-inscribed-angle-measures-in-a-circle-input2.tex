Solve for the missing angle or arc measure.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If an inscribed angle measures $y^\circ$ and its intercepted arc is $4y - 5^\circ$, find $y$.
 %   \item The intercepted arc of an inscribed angle measures $5z + 15^\circ$, while the inscribed angle is $2.5z^\circ$. Find $z$.
    \item Two inscribed angles intercept the same arc. If one angle is $6x - 12^\circ$ and the other is $4x + 18^\circ$, find $x$.
   % \item An angle is inscribed in a semicircle. Express its measure algebraically.
    \item The minor arc of a circle measures $y + 50^\circ$. Express the measure of the major arc in terms of $y$.
   % \item A cyclic quadrilateral has opposite angles of $4x + 10^\circ$ and $6x - 20^\circ$. Find $x$.
    \item The intercepted arc is twice the measure of an inscribed angle. If the arc is $10y - 20^\circ$, find the inscribed angle.
    %\item A chord divides a circle into two arcs. The larger arc is $4y^\circ$ and the smaller arc is $(3y + 30)^\circ$. Find $y$.
    \item The sum of two adjacent inscribed angles is $200^\circ$. If one measures $5x + 15^\circ$ and the other is $3x^\circ$, find $x$.
   % \item If an intercepted arc measures $6z + 25^\circ$ and the inscribed angle that intercepts it measures $3z + 15^\circ$, find $z$.
\end{enumerate}
