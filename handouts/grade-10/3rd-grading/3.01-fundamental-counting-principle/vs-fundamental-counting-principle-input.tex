\noindent \textbf{Fundamental Counting Principle (FCP):} If one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second event can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events together can occur in \(m \times n\) ways.

\noindent\textbf{Steps for Using FCP}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify each event in the problem.
    \item Determine how many possible outcomes there are for each event.
    \item Multiply the number of outcomes for each event to find the total number of possible arrangements.
\end{enumerate}
