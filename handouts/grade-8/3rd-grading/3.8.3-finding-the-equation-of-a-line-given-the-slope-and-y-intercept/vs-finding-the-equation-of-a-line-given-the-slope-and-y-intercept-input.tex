\noindent\textbf{Steps to Find the Equation of a Line}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the slope $m$ and the $y$-intercept $b$.
    \item Substitute the values of $m$ and $b$ into the slope-intercept form equation:
    \[
    y = mx + b
    \]
    \item Simplify the equation (if needed). In some cases, simplifying the equation may be necessary if it was given in another form.
\end{enumerate}
