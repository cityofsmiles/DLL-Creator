\section*{Lesson Overview}

In this lesson, students will investigate, interpret, and analyze graphs that represent primary data such as examination scores. By analyzing bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and histograms, students will learn to extract meaningful insights from the data and draw conclusions.

\section*{Key Terms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Data}: Data collected directly from first-hand sources.
    \item \textbf{Bar Graph}: A chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars.
    \item \textbf{Line Graph}: A graph that uses lines to connect data points to show trends over time.
    \item \textbf{Pie Chart}: A circular graph divided into slices to show proportional data.
    \item \textbf{Histogram}: A graph showing the distribution of numerical data, where each bar represents a range of data values.
    \item \textbf{Interpretation}: Understanding the message that the graph conveys about the data.
    \item \textbf{Analysis}: Breaking down the graph into its elements to extract key information.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Steps for Interpreting and Analyzing Graphs}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Read the title}: Understand the topic or subject of the graph.
    \item \textbf{Check the axes and labels}: Determine what the graph is measuring and how the data is divided.
    \item \textbf{Look for patterns}: Identify trends, peaks, drops, or clusters in the data.
    \item \textbf{Analyze proportions}: In pie charts or bar graphs, consider how each part compares to the whole.
    \item \textbf{Draw conclusions}: Based on the trends and patterns, what can be said about the data?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Practice Exercises}

For the following exercises, interpret and analyze the given graphs, then answer the questions based on your observations.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bar Graph}: A bar graph shows the exam scores of 5 students in a math test. The scores are 85, 90, 78, 88, and 92. Interpret the graph to answer:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Who scored the highest and lowest?
        \item What is the average score?
        \item Is there a large variation in the scores?
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Line Graph}: A line graph shows the number of hours spent studying over a week: Monday (2 hours), Tuesday (3 hours), Wednesday (4 hours), Thursday (3.5 hours), and Friday (4.5 hours).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On which day was the maximum time spent studying?
        \item Describe the trend in study hours over the week.
        \item Did the study time increase steadily?
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Pie Chart}: A pie chart shows the distribution of marks in an exam for different subjects: Math (40\%), Science (25\%), English (20\%), and History (15\%).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which subject took up the largest portion of the marks?
        \item Which two subjects combined make up 45\% of the marks?
        \item How do the marks for English and History compare?
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Histogram}: A histogram shows the number of students scoring in the following ranges on a test: 60-70 (3 students), 70-80 (5 students), 80-90 (7 students), 90-100 (2 students).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which score range had the most students?
        \item How many students scored above 80?
        \item What does the histogram suggest about the overall performance?
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Bar Graph}: A bar graph shows the sales data of a shop over 4 months: January (\$500), February (\$650), March (\$600), and April (\$700).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In which month were the sales the highest?
        \item Calculate the total sales over the 4 months.
        \item Is there a consistent trend in sales?
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Line Graph}: A line graph represents the daily temperature over a week: Day 1 (25°C), Day 2 (28°C), Day 3 (27°C), Day 4 (29°C), Day 5 (30°C).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which day had the highest temperature?
        \item Describe the trend in temperature over the week.
        \item Did the temperature decrease at any point?
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Pie Chart}: A pie chart shows the time spent on different activities in a day: Sleeping (30\%), School (35\%), Homework (10\%), Leisure (25\%).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which activity takes up the most time?
        \item What fraction of the day is spent on school and homework combined?
        \item Is more time spent on leisure or sleeping?
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Histogram}: A histogram shows the ages of students in a class: 10-12 years (5 students), 12-14 years (8 students), 14-16 years (6 students).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which age group has the largest number of students?
        \item How many students are there in total?
        \item What does this histogram suggest about the age distribution?
