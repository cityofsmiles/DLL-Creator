Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A tangent and a secant intersect outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $130^\circ$ and $50^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
 %   \item A tangent and a secant intersect outside a circle, forming an angle of $40^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $60^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    \item The intercepted arcs of a tangent and a secant measure $150^\circ$ and $70^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    %\item A tangent and a secant intersect outside a circle. The exterior angle measures $55^\circ$, and the minor intercepted arc is $90^\circ$. Find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    \item Find the measure of the exterior angle formed by a tangent and a secant intercepting arcs measuring $170^\circ$ and $90^\circ$.
    %\item A tangent-secant angle measures $50^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc is $140^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    \item A tangent and a secant form an exterior angle of $60^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $80^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    %\item The exterior angle formed by a tangent and a secant is $45^\circ$. The intercepted arcs differ by $50^\circ$. Find their measures.
    \item A tangent and a secant intersect outside a circle, creating an angle of $48^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc measures $160^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    %\item The intercepted arcs of a tangent and a secant measure $180^\circ$ and $100^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
