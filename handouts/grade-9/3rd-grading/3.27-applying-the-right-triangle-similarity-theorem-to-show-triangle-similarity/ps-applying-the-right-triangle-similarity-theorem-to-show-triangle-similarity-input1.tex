Use the Right Triangle Similarity Theorem to prove that the given triangles are similar or to solve for unknown lengths.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), and \(CD\) is an altitude to the hypotenuse \(AB\). If \(AC = 6\), \(CB = 8\), and \(AB = 10\), show that \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle ACD \sim \triangle CBD\).
    \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(\angle Z = 90^\circ\), and \(ZW\) is an altitude to the hypotenuse \(XY\). If \(XZ = 9\), \(ZY = 12\), and \(XY = 15\), verify the similarity of the triangles.
    \item In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle R = 90^\circ\), and \(RS\) is an altitude to the hypotenuse \(PQ\). If \(PR = 5\), \(RQ = 12\), and \(PQ = 13\), calculate the length of \(RS\).
 %   \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(\angle F = 90^\circ\), and \(FG\) is an altitude to \(DE\). If \(DF = 8\), \(EF = 15\), and \(DE = 17\), prove that \(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle DFG \sim \triangle EFG\).
  %  \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), and \(CD\) is an altitude to \(AB\). If \(AC = 7\), \(CB = 24\), and \(AB = 25\), find the lengths of \(AD\) and \(BD\).
    % \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(\angle Z = 90^\circ\), and \(ZW\) is an altitude to \(XY\). If \(XZ = 5\), \(ZY = 12\), and \(XY = 13\), find the length of \(ZW\).
    % \item In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle R = 90^\circ\), and \(RS\) is an altitude to \(PQ\). If \(PR = 9\), \(RQ = 40\), and \(PQ = 41\), show that \(\triangle PQR \sim \triangle PRS \sim \triangle QRS\).
    % \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(\angle F = 90^\circ\), and \(FG\) is an altitude to \(DE\). If \(DF = 6\), \(EF = 8\), and \(DE = 10\), find the length of \(FG\).
    % \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), and \(CD\) is an altitude to \(AB\). If \(AC = 9\), \(CB = 12\), and \(AB = 15\), verify the similarity of the triangles.
    % \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(\angle Z = 90^\circ\), and \(ZW\) is an altitude to \(XY\). If \(XZ = 4\), \(ZY = 3\), and \(XY = 5\), prove that \(\triangle XYZ \sim \triangle XZW \sim \triangle YZW\).
