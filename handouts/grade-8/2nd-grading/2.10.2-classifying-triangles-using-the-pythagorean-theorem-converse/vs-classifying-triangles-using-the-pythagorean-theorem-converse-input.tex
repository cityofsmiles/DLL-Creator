\textbf{Lesson 2.10.2: Classifying Triangles using the Converse of Pythagorean Theorem}
\end{center}

\vspace*{1ex}

\textbf{Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem:} If the square of the longest side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is a right triangle.

To classify triangles based on the relationship between the sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(c\) is the longest side):
\[
\begin{aligned}
    &\text{If } c^2=a^2 + b^2, \text{ the triangle is a right triangle.} \\
    &\text{If } c^2 <  a^2 + b^2, \text{ the triangle is an acute triangle.} \\
    &\text{If } c^2 > a^2 + b^2, \text{ the triangle is an obtuse triangle.}
\end{aligned}
\]
