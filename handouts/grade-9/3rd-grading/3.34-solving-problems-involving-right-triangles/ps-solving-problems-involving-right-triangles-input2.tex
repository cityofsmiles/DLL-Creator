Solve the following problems involving right triangles.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In a right triangle, the legs measure 9 cm and 12 cm. Find the hypotenuse.
    \item A ladder leans against a wall, making a \(45^\circ\) angle with the ground. If the ladder is 15 ft long, find how far up the wall it reaches.
    \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(\angle F = 90^\circ\), \(DE = 20\), and \(DF = 16\). Find \(EF\).
    \item A ramp makes a \(30^\circ\) angle with the ground and is 10 ft long. Find the height of the ramp above the ground.
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse measures 17 cm and one leg is 8 cm. Find the other leg.
    \item An observer is standing 40 m away from the base of a building. The angle of elevation to the top of the building is \(30^\circ\). Find the height of the building.
    \item A triangle has sides measuring 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. Verify if it is a right triangle.
    \item A kite string is 25 m long and makes a \(60^\circ\) angle with the ground. Find the vertical height of the kite.
    \item In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle R = 90^\circ\), \(PQ = 26\), and \(QR = 10\). Find \(PR\).
    \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(\angle Z = 90^\circ\), \(XY = 17\), and \(YZ = 15\). Find \(XZ\).
    %\item A ladder is 15 ft long and reaches a height of 12 ft on a wall. Find the angle it makes with the ground.
