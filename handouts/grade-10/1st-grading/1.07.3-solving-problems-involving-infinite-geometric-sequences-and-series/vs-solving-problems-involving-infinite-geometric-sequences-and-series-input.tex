\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{infinite geometric sequence} is a sequence that continues indefinitely with a common ratio \(r\).
    \item An \textbf{infinite geometric series} is the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric sequence.
    % \item If \(|r| < 1\), the infinite geometric series has a finite sum given by:
    %       \[ S = \dfrac{a_1}{1 - r} \]
    %       where:
    %       \begin{itemize}
    %           \item \( S \) is the sum of the infinite geometric series,
    %           \item \( a_1 \) is the first term, and
    %           \item \( r \) is the common ratio.
    %       \end{itemize}
    % \item If \(|r| \geq 1\), the series is \textbf{divergent} and does not have a finite sum.
    \item Infinite geometric series are applied in real-world problems, such as physics, economics, and finance.
\end{itemize}
