Use the Right Triangle Similarity Theorem to prove that the given triangles are similar or to solve for unknown lengths.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle R = 90^\circ\), and \(RS\) is an altitude to the hypotenuse \(PQ\). If \(PR = 12\), \(RQ = 16\), and \(PQ = 20\), show that \(\triangle PQR \sim \triangle PRS \sim \triangle QRS\).
    \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(\angle F = 90^\circ\), and \(FG\) is an altitude to the hypotenuse \(DE\). If \(DF = 7\), \(EF = 24\), and \(DE = 25\), verify the similarity of the triangles.
    \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(\angle Z = 90^\circ\), and \(ZW\) is an altitude to \(XY\). If \(XZ = 8\), \(ZY = 15\), and \(XY = 17\), find the length of \(ZW\).
    \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), and \(CD\) is an altitude to \(AB\). If \(AC = 10\), \(CB = 24\), and \(AB = 26\), prove that \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle ACD \sim \triangle CBD\).
    \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(\angle F = 90^\circ\), and \(FG\) is an altitude to \(DE\). If \(DF = 15\), \(EF = 20\), and \(DE = 25\), find the lengths of \(DG\) and \(EG\).
    % \item In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle R = 90^\circ\), and \(RS\) is an altitude to \(PQ\). If \(PR = 6\), \(RQ = 8\), and \(PQ = 10\), find the length of \(RS\).
    % \item In \(\triangle XYZ\), \(\angle Z = 90^\circ\), and \(ZW\) is an altitude to \(XY\). If \(XZ = 9\), \(ZY = 40\), and \(XY = 41\), verify the similarity of the triangles.
    % \item In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), and \(CD\) is an altitude to \(AB\). If \(AC = 8\), \(CB = 15\), and \(AB = 17\), find the length of \(CD\).
    % \item In \(\triangle DEF\), \(\angle F = 90^\circ\), and \(FG\) is an altitude to \(DE\). If \(DF = 5\), \(EF = 12\), and \(DE = 13\), show that \(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle DFG \sim \triangle EFG\).
    % \item In \(\triangle PQR\), \(\angle R = 90^\circ\), and \(RS\) is an altitude to \(PQ\). If \(PR = 3\), \(RQ = 4\), and \(PQ = 5\), prove that \(\triangle PQR \sim \triangle PRS \sim \triangle QRS\).
