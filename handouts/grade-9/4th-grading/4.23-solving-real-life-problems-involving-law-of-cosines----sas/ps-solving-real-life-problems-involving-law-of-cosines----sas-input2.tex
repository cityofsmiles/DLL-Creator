Solve the following real-life problems using the Law of Cosines.  

\begin{enumerate}
    % \item Two towers are 60 m and 80 m tall, and the distance between their bases is 120 m. The angle between the lines of sight from the top of each tower to the ground is \(70^\circ\). Find the distance between the tops of the towers.
    % \item A triangular plot of land has two adjacent sides measuring 50 m and 70 m with an included angle of \(50^\circ\). Find the length of the third side of the triangle.
    % \item A ship travels 6 km north, then turns \(130^\circ\) to its right and travels 9 km. Find the distance between the starting and ending points of the ship.
    % \item A triangular garden has sides of 30 m and 40 m forming an angle of \(80^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    % \item A triangular parcel of land has sides of 150 m and 200 m forming an angle of \(45^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    \item Two points on a mountain are connected by paths of lengths 400 m and 600 m, forming an angle of \(100^\circ\). Find the straight-line distance between the two points.
    \item A kite is flying 120 m away from a point on the ground. The string forms an angle of \(55^\circ\) with the ground, and the distance between the kite and a nearby tree is 110 m. Find the distance between the point on the ground and the tree.
    \item A triangular swimming pool has two sides measuring 18 m and 25 m, with an included angle of \(65^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    \item Two airplanes flying at the same altitude are 250 km and 350 km away from an air traffic control tower, forming an angle of \(50^\circ\) between their flight paths. Find the distance between the airplanes.
    \item A triangular roof truss has sides of 15 m and 20 m forming an angle of \(75^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
\end{enumerate}
