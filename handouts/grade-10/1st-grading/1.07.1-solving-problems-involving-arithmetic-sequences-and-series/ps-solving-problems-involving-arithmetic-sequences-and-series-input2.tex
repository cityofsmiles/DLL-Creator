Solve the following problems involving arithmetic sequences and series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the 18th term of the arithmetic sequence: \(2, 6, 10, 14, \dots\)
    \item Determine the sum of the first 25 terms of the arithmetic sequence: \(4, 8, 12, 16, \dots\)
    \item The first term of an arithmetic sequence is 15, and the common difference is 5. Find the 12th term.
    \item If the 6th term of an arithmetic sequence is 30 and the 12th term is 60, find the common difference.
    \item Find the sum of the first 40 terms of the arithmetic sequence: \(3, 6, 9, 12, \dots\)
    \item A ramp has 15 steps, each step increasing in height by 3 cm. If the first step is 12 cm, find the height of the last step.
    \item Find the sum of all multiples of 5 between 1 and 150.
    \item A company gives a starting salary of \$28,000 and increases the salary by \$1,500 every year. Find the salary in the 10th year.
    \item The first term of an arithmetic sequence is \( -2 \), and the common difference is \( 4 \). Find the 15th term.
    \item A person saves \$600 in the first month and increases the savings by \$150 each month. Find the total savings after 10 months.
