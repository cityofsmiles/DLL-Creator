\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{central angle} is an angle whose vertex is at the \textbf{center} of the circle and whose sides are \textbf{radii}.
    \item The measure of a \textbf{central angle} is equal to the degree measure of its \textbf{intercepted arc}.
    \item The sum of all central angles in a circle is $360^\circ$.
    \item The measure of a \textbf{minor arc} is less than $180^\circ$, while the measure of a \textbf{major arc} is greater than $180^\circ$.
    \item The formula for the \textbf{arc length} $s$ of a circle is:
      
{\centering $ 
    s = r\theta
$\par}
    where $r$ is the \textbf{radius} and $\theta$ is the \textbf{central angle} in \textbf{radians}.
  \item To convert degrees to radians, use:
    
{\centering $
    \theta = \dfrac{\pi}{180^\circ} \times \text{angle in degrees}
$\par}
\item To convert radians to degrees, use:
  
{\centering $ 
    \text{angle in degrees} = \dfrac{180^\circ}{\pi} \times \theta
$\par}
\end{itemize}
