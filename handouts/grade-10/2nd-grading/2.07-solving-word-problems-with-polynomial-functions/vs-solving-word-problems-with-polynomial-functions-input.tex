\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{polynomial function} is a function of the form:

{\centering $
    f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0
    $\par}
  
    where $a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0$ are real numbers and $n$ is a non-negative integer.
    
    \item Polynomial functions are used to model real-life situations such as motion, area calculations, and revenue-cost analysis.
    
    \item To solve a word problem involving polynomial functions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define the variables.
        \item Write the polynomial equation based on the given conditions.
        \item Solve for the unknown values using algebraic techniques.
        \item Interpret the solution in the context of the problem.
    \end{itemize}
    
    % \item Common methods for solving polynomial equations include:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Factoring
    %     \item Synthetic division
    %     \item Quadratic formula (for degree 2)
    %     \item Graphing
    % \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
