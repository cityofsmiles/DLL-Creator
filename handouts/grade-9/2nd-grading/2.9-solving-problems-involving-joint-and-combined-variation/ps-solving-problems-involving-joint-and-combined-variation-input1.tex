\item The area \(A\) of a triangle varies jointly as its base \(b\) and height \(h\). If \(A = 30\) when \(b = 5\) and \(h = 12\), find \(A\) when \(b = 6\) and \(h = 10\).

\item The current \(I\) in an electrical circuit varies directly as the voltage \(V\) and inversely as the resistance \(R\). If \(I = 10\) A when \(V = 100\) volts and \(R = 10\) ohms, find \(I\) when \(V = 120\) volts and \(R = 8\) ohms.
  
\item The volume \(V\) of a prism varies jointly as the area of its base \(B\) and its height \(h\). If \(V = 100\) cubic units when \(B = 10\) square units and \(h = 10\) units, find \(V\) when \(B = 12\) square units and \(h = 8\) units.

\item The speed \(v\) of a wave varies directly as its frequency \(f\) and inversely as its wavelength \(\lambda\). If \(v = 300\) m/s when \(f = 15\) Hz and \(\lambda = 2\) m, find \(v\) when \(f = 20\) Hz and \(\lambda = 2.5\) m.
  
    \item The force \(F\) required to move an object varies jointly as the mass \(m\) of the object and its acceleration \(a\). If \(F = 50\) N when \(m = 5\) kg and \(a = 2\) m/s\(^2\), find \(F\) when \(m = 6\) kg and \(a = 3\) m/s\(^2\).
  %  \item The gravitational force \(F\) between two masses varies jointly as the product of the masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), and inversely as the square of the distance \(d\) between them. If \(F = 40\) N when \(m_1 = 4\) kg, \(m_2 = 5\) kg, and \(d = 2\) meters, find \(F\) when \(m_1 = 6\) kg, \(m_2 = 4\) kg, and \(d = 3\) meters.
   % \item The surface area \(S\) of a cylinder varies jointly as the radius \(r\) and the height \(h\). If \(S = 150\) square units when \(r = 3\) units and \(h = 5\) units, find \(S\) when \(r = 4\) units and \(h = 7\) units.

    %\item The intensity \(I\) of a light source varies directly as the power \(P\) of the light source and inversely as the square of the distance \(d\) from the source. If \(I = 200\) when \(P = 50\) and \(d = 2\) meters, find \(I\) when \(P = 60\) and \(d = 3\) meters.
    %\item The pressure \(P\) of a gas varies directly as its temperature \(T\) and inversely as its volume \(V\). If \(P = 80\) kPa when \(T = 300\) K and \(V = 4\) liters, find \(P\) when \(T = 350\) K and \(V = 5\) liters.
    %\item The number of hours \(h\) required to complete a task varies directly as the size of the task \(s\) and inversely as the number of workers \(w\) assigned. If \(h = 12\) hours when \(s = 100\) units and \(w = 5\) workers, find \(h\) when \(s = 120\) units and \(w = 6\) workers.
