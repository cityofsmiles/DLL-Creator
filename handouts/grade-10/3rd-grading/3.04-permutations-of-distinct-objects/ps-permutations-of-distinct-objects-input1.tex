    \item How many distinct permutations can be made from 6 objects taken 3 at a time?
    \item Calculate \(P(8, 4)\).
    \item How many ways can 9 objects be arranged taken 6 at a time?
    \item If \(n = 10\) and \(r = 5\), find \(P(n, r)\).
    \item Determine the number of permutations of 7 objects taken 4 at a time.
    \item Solve for \(P(11, 9)\).
    \item Find the number of distinct arrangements of 5 objects taken 3 at a time.
