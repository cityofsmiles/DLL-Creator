Solve the following problems involving infinite geometric sequences and series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine whether the infinite geometric series \(3 + 2 + \dfrac{4}{3} + \dfrac{8}{9} + \dots\) has a finite sum.
    \item Find the sum of the infinite geometric series: \(5 + 2.5 + 1.25 + 0.625 + \dots\)
    \item Determine the common ratio and state whether the series \(1 + \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{9} + \dots\) converges.
    \item If an infinite geometric series has \(a_1 = 7\) and \(r = 0.4\), find its sum.
    \item Find the sum of the infinite geometric series: \(10 + 5 + 2.5 + 1.25 + \dots\)
    \item A bouncing ball reaches \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) of its previous height. If it starts at 10 meters, find the total distance it travels.
    \item A pendulum swings 80\% of its previous amplitude. If its first swing is 50 cm, find the total distance it swings.
    \item Determine the sum of the infinite geometric series: \(6 + 3 + 1.5 + 0.75 + \dots\)
    \item A person receives a salary that decreases by 10\% each year from an initial amount of \$5000. Find the total amount they earn.
    \item A water droplet splits into 3 smaller drops, each of which splits again. If the initial drop has a volume of 1 mL, find the total volume.
