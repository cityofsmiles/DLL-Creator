Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item A circle has a radius of $10$ cm. Find the area of a sector with a central angle of $60^\circ$.
    \item A circle has a radius of $12$ cm. Find the area of a sector with a central angle of $90^\circ$.
    %\item Find the area of a segment of a circle with radius $8$ cm and a central angle of $45^\circ$.
    \item A tangent to a circle forms an angle of $50^\circ$ with a chord drawn to the point of tangency. Find the measure of the intercepted arc.
    %\item A secant intersects a circle at two points, and the intercepted arcs measure $80^\circ$ and $40^\circ$. Find the measure of the angle formed by the secant and a tangent at the point of tangency.
    \item A sector has an area of $25\pi$ cm² and a central angle of $72^\circ$. Find the radius of the circle.
    %\item Find the area of a segment in a circle of radius $6$ cm with a central angle of $60^\circ$.
    \item A secant and a tangent intersect at a point outside the circle. The intercepted arcs measure $100^\circ$ and $40^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle formed.
    %\item A tangent and a radius meet at the point of tangency. If the radius is $10$ cm and the point of tangency is $24$ cm away from an external point on the tangent, find the length of the tangent segment.
    \item A sector has a central angle of $120^\circ$ and an area of $40\pi$ cm². Find the radius of the circle.
