\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{arithmetic mean} is a term inserted between two given terms in an \textbf{arithmetic sequence}.
    \item The common difference $d$ can be found using the formula:

{\centering $  d = \dfrac{a_{n} - a_{1}}{n+1}  $\par}
      %\[ d = \dfrac{a_{n} - a_{1}}{n+1} \]
 \noindent    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a_1$ is the first given term,
        \item $a_n$ is the last given term, and
        \item $n$ is the number of arithmetic means to be inserted.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Once $d$ is determined, the arithmetic means can be found by successively adding $d$ to $a_1$.
\end{itemize}
