\noindent Use the given information to determine if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Provide a brief explanation for your answer.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item A quadrilateral has both pairs of opposite sides measuring 5 cm each.
    \item A quadrilateral has both pairs of opposite angles equal to \(120^\circ\).
    \item Each pair of consecutive angles in a quadrilateral sums to \(180^\circ\).
    \item The diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other and form two equal segments.
    \item One pair of opposite sides in a quadrilateral is both parallel and measures 7 cm.
    \item The diagonals of a quadrilateral divide it into two triangles of equal area.
    \item A quadrilateral has one pair of opposite sides that are congruent and another pair that are parallel.
    \item In a quadrilateral, both pairs of opposite angles measure \(100^\circ\) and \(80^\circ\).
    \item The diagonals of a quadrilateral intersect and each diagonal measures 12 cm, with the intersection dividing each into two 6 cm segments.
    \item Both pairs of opposite sides in a quadrilateral are equal in length and parallel.
\end{enumerate}
