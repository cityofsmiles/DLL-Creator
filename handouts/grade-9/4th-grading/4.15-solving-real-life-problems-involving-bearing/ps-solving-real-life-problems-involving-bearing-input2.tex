Solve the following problems completely.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A ship sails 6 km on a bearing of \(070^\circ\), then 9 km on a bearing of \(130^\circ\). Calculate the ship's final position relative to its starting point.

    \item A plane flies 12 km on a bearing of \(040^\circ\), then 18 km on a bearing of \(160^\circ\). Find the resultant displacement of the plane.

    \item A hiker walks 7 km on a bearing of \(050^\circ\), then 5 km on a bearing of \(140^\circ\). Determine the hiker’s final position relative to the starting point.

    \item A ship travels 15 km on a bearing of \(100^\circ\), then 10 km on a bearing of \(190^\circ\). Calculate the distance and bearing of the ship from its starting point.

    \item A cyclist rides 8 km on a bearing of \(310^\circ\), then 10 km on a bearing of \(050^\circ\). Find the cyclist’s resultant displacement.

    % \item A plane flies 22 km on a bearing of \(250^\circ\), then 18 km on a bearing of \(330^\circ\). Calculate the plane’s position relative to the starting point.

    % \item A ship sails 11 km on a bearing of \(220^\circ\), then 7 km on a bearing of \(100^\circ\). Determine the ship’s final displacement.

    % \item A hiker walks 9 km on a bearing of \(340^\circ\), then 6 km on a bearing of \(040^\circ\). Calculate the hiker’s final position relative to the starting point.

    % \item A plane flies 28 km on a bearing of \(130^\circ\), then 35 km on a bearing of \(250^\circ\). Find the resultant displacement of the plane.

    % \item A ship sails 20 km on a bearing of \(160^\circ\), then 14 km on a bearing of \(220^\circ\). Determine the ship’s position relative to its starting point.
