Solve the following problems using the distance formula and equation of a circle.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A point $P(-3,7)$ lies on a circle centered at $C(2,1)$. Find the equation of the circle.
 %   \item Find the radius of a circle if its center is at $(5,-2)$ and it passes through the point $(10,6)$.
    \item Determine whether the point $(-4,3)$ is inside, outside, or on the circle given by the equation $(x + 2)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 36$.
  %  \item A circular swimming pool has its center at $(2,5)$ and passes through the point $(7,9)$. What is the area of the pool?
    \item A satellite orbits above a station located at $(1,2)$. If it can travel up to $15$ units, write the equation of the boundary it can cover.
%    \item Two points $A(1,4)$ and $B(7,8)$ are endpoints of a diameter of a circle. Find the equation of the circle.
    \item A lighthouse is located at $(3,6)$ and can illuminate an area within $10$ km. Write the equation of the circle representing its range.
 %   \item A monument is centered at $(8,-5)$ with a radius of $5$ meters. A tourist is standing at $(3,0)$. Is the tourist inside or outside the monumentâ€™s boundary?
    \item The equation of a circle is $x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 10y + 20 = 0$. Find the center and radius of the circle.
 %   \item A WiFi router is placed at $(-2,4)$. It has a signal range of $20$ meters. What is the equation of its coverage area?
\end{enumerate}
