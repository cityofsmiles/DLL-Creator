Solve the following word problems by applying the concepts of polynomial functions.

\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item A rectangle has a length of $x+3$ and a width of $x-2$. Express its area as a polynomial.
    \item The volume of a box is given by $V = x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x$. Factor the polynomial to find possible dimensions of the box.
    %\item A quadratic function models the height $h(t) = -16t^2 + 64t$ of a projectile. Find the time when the projectile reaches the ground.
    \item The revenue from selling $x$ items is given by $R(x) = -2x^2 + 30x$. Determine the number of items that maximizes revenue.
    %\item A cube has a volume of $x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6$. Factor the polynomial and determine the possible integer side lengths.
    \item The sum of two consecutive integers is expressed as $x^2 + x$. Find the integers if their sum is 20.
    %\item A carâ€™s distance traveled is modeled by $d(t) = 3t^2 + 5t$. Find $d(4)$.
    \item The cost to produce $x$ items is given by $C(x) = 5x^2 - 25x + 50$. Find the cost when $x = 10$.
    %\item The area of a triangle is given by $A = \dfrac{1}{2} (x^2 + 4x)$. Find the area when $x = 6$.
    \item A rectangular garden has an area given by $A = x^2 + 5x + 6$. Factor to find possible dimensions of the garden.
