\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 5 \) and \( r = 2 \).
  %  \item Find the sum of the first 5 terms of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 6 \) and \( r = 4 \).
    \item Find the sum of the first 7 terms of the geometric sequence: 3, 9, 27, 81, ...
%    \item Find the sum of the first 8 terms of the geometric sequence: 7, 21, 63, 189, ...
    \item Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = \dfrac{1}{3} \).
 %   \item Find the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 12 \) and \( r = -2 \).
    \item Find the sum of the first 9 terms of the geometric sequence: 4, 12, 36, 108, ...
%    \item Find the sum of the first 5 terms of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 9 \) and \( r = -4 \).
