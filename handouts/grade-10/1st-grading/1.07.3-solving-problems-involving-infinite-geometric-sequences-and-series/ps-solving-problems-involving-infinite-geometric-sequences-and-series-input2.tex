Solve the following problems involving infinite geometric sequences and series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine whether the infinite geometric series \(4 + 2 + 1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dots\) has a finite sum.
    %\item Find the sum of the infinite geometric series: \(8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + \dots\)
    \item Determine the common ratio and state whether the series \(2 + \dfrac{2}{5} + \dfrac{2}{25} + \dots\) converges.
    %\item If an infinite geometric series has \(a_1 = 9\) and \(r = 0.3\), find its sum.
    \item Find the sum of the infinite geometric series: \(12 + 6 + 3 + 1.5 + \dots\)
    %\item A bouncing ball reaches \(\dfrac{1}{3}\) of its previous height. If it starts at 15 meters, find the total distance it travels.
    \item A pendulum swings 75\% of its previous amplitude. If its first swing is 60 cm, find the total distance it swings.
    %\item Determine the sum of the infinite geometric series: \(7 + 3.5 + 1.75 + 0.875 + \dots\)
    \item A person receives a salary that decreases by 5\% each year from an initial amount of \$6000. Find the total amount they earn.
 %   \item A virus spreads at a rate of doubling each cycle. If the initial infection is 2 individuals, find the total infections assuming infinite cycles.
\end{enumerate}
