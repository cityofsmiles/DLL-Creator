\begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{arithmetic sequence} is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
    \item This constant difference is called the \textbf{common difference} and is denoted as $d$.
    \item The general form of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a_n$ is the nth term,
        \item $a_1$ is the first term, and
        \item $d$ is the common difference.
    \end{itemize}
    \item To find the next terms in an arithmetic sequence, simply add the common difference to the last known term.
\end{itemize}
