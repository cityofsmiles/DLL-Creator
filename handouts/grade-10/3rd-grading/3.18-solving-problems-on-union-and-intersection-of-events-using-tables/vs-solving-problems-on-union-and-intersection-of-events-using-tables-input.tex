\noindent\textbf{Step-by-Step Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the events involved in the problem.
    \item Organize the information in a table form.
    \item Use the table to calculate the union (\(A \cup B\)) or intersection (\(A \cap B\)) of the events.
    \item To calculate the union, add the values of individual events and subtract the overlap (intersection).
    \item To calculate the intersection, find the common outcomes between the two events.
\end{enumerate}
