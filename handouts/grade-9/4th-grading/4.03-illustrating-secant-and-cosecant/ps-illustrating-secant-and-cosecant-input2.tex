Solve the following problems. Write your answers in simplest fractional form where applicable.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 15 units, and the adjacent side is 9 units. Find $\sec P$.
    %\item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 17 units, and the adjacent side is 15 units. Find $\sec Q$.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\sec R = \dfrac{13}{12}$. If the adjacent side is 6 units, find the hypotenuse.
    \item In a right triangle, $\csc S = \dfrac{8}{5}$. If the opposite side is 25 units, find the hypotenuse.
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 34 units, and the opposite side is 30 units. Find $\csc T$.
 %   \item A right triangle has $\sec U = \dfrac{20}{12}$. If the adjacent side is 9 units, find the hypotenuse.
   % \item In a right triangle, $\csc V = \dfrac{15}{12}$. If the opposite side is 8 units, find the hypotenuse.
    \item A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 units and an adjacent side of 6 units. Find $\sec W$.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\sec X = \dfrac{9}{7}$. If the adjacent side is 14 units, find the hypotenuse.
    \item In a right triangle, $\csc Y = \dfrac{12}{5}$. If the opposite side is 5 units, find the hypotenuse.
\end{enumerate}
