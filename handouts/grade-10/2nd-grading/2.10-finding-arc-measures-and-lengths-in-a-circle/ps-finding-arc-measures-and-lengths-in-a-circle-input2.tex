Solve for the missing angle or arc length.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the central angle measures $95^\circ$, what is the measure of its intercepted arc?
  %  \item A circle is divided into three central angles: $y^\circ$, $3y^\circ$, and $4y^\circ$. Find $y$.
    \item The minor arc measures $120^\circ$. Find the measure of the corresponding major arc.
    %\item If the arc length is $12$ cm and the radius is $6$ cm, find the central angle in radians.
    \item Find the length of an arc intercepted by a central angle of $75^\circ$ in a circle with a radius of $10$ cm.
    %\item A semicircle is divided into two arcs. If one arc measures $y^\circ$ and the other measures $2y + 30^\circ$, find $y$.
    \item Convert $150^\circ$ to radians.
    %\item Convert $\dfrac{2\pi}{5}$ radians to degrees.
    \item The sum of two adjacent central angles is $170^\circ$. If one measures $5y + 10^\circ$ and the other measures $3y^\circ$, find $y$.
    %\item If an arc measures $3\pi$ cm and the radius is $6$ cm, find the central angle in radians.
\end{enumerate}
