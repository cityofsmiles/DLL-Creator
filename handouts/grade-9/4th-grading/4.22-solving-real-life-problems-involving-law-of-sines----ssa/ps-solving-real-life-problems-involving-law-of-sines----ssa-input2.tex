Solve the following real-life problems. 

\begin{enumerate}
    % \item A flagpole casts a shadow 18 m long. The angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is \(35^\circ\), and the distance from the base of the pole to the shadow's tip is 25 m. Find the height of the flagpole.
    % \item A ship is anchored 40 km from a lighthouse. The angle from the lighthouse to the ship is \(30^\circ\), and the ship is 70 km away from another lighthouse in the same direction. Determine the possible locations of the ship.
    % \item A tree is 25 m tall, and the angle of elevation to its top is \(50^\circ\). A bird flies 35 m away from the tree at an angle of \(45^\circ\). Find the possible heights of the bird above the ground.
    % \item A plane is flying at an altitude of 1,500 m. From an observer on the ground, the angle of elevation to the plane is \(40^\circ\), and the horizontal distance to the plane is 2,000 m. Find the possible distances from the observer to the plane.
    % \item A triangular field has a side of 250 m, with an angle of \(55^\circ\) opposite another side measuring 180 m. Find the possible lengths of the third side.
    \item A lighthouse beam forms angles of \(55^\circ\) and \(65^\circ\) with two ships. The first ship is 60 km away from the lighthouse, and the second ship is 90 km away. Find the possible distances between the ships.
    \item A tree is 20 m tall. A point 12 m away forms a shadow angle of \(40^\circ\), and the same shadow point forms another angle of \(35^\circ\) with the tree top. Determine the possible heights of the tree's shadow.
    \item Two airplanes form angles of \(35^\circ\) and \(45^\circ\) with an air traffic control tower. The planes are 7 km apart, and the closer plane is 4 km from the tower. Find the possible distances of the second plane from the tower.
    \item A cyclist travels 12 km north, then turns and travels at an angle of \(70^\circ\) to the original direction for 18 km. Find the possible locations of the cyclist.
    \item A hot air balloon is 600 m above the ground. The angles of elevation to the balloon from two points 350 m apart on the ground are \(25^\circ\) and \(35^\circ\). Find the possible locations of the balloon.
