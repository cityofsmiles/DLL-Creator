Solve each problem completely.

\begin{enumerate}
 % %   \item A person standing on a 25-meter cliff looks down at a kayak with an angle of depression of \(35^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance from the person to the kayak.
% %    \item A plane flying at an altitude of 400 meters observes a bus on the ground at an angle of depression of \(30^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance from the plane to the bus.
%     \item From a lighthouse 40 meters tall, the angle of depression to a boat is \(30^\circ\). Find the distance of the boat from the base of the lighthouse.
%     \item A drone hovers 120 meters above the ground and observes a car with an angle of depression of \(20^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the car.
%   %  \item A skier at the top of a hill 60 meters high looks down at the base of the hill at an angle of depression of \(50^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the base of the hill.
    \item A lifeguard sitting in a chair 6 meters above the beach sees a paddleboarder with an angle of depression of \(25^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the paddleboarder.
    \item A person on a 30-meter-tall building observes a motorcycle with an angle of depression of \(40^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the motorcycle.
    \item A helicopter is hovering at a height of 250 meters and observes a tower at an angle of depression of \(50^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the tower.
    \item From the top of a cliff 100 meters high, the angle of depression to a sailboat is \(45^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the sailboat.
    \item A hot air balloon floating at 200 meters observes a tree with an angle of depression of \(15^\circ\). Find the horizontal distance to the tree.
