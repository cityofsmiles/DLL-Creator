\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{geometric sequence} is a sequence in which each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the \textbf{common ratio}, denoted as $r$.
    \item The formula for the $n$th term of a geometric sequence is:

{\centering $  a_n = a r^{n-1}  $\par}
      %\[ a_n = a r^{n-1} \]
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a$ is the first term,
        \item $r$ is the common ratio (found by dividing any term by the previous term), and
        \item $n$ is the number of terms.
    \end{itemize}
    \item To find the \textbf{missing term}, use the general formula and solve for the unknown value.
    \item To determine the \textbf{common ratio}, divide any term by the preceding term.
    \item To find the \textbf{number of terms}, use the general formula and solve for $n$.
\end{itemize}
