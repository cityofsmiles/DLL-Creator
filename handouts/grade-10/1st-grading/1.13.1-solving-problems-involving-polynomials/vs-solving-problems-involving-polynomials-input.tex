\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{polynomial} is an algebraic expression consisting of variables, coefficients, and exponents combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
    \item The \textbf{degree} of a polynomial is determined by the highest exponent of its variable.
    \item To solve problems involving polynomials:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perform \textbf{addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division} of polynomials.
        \item Use the \textbf{Remainder Theorem} and \textbf{Factor Theorem} to check for divisibility.
        \item Factorize polynomials to find their roots.
        \item Apply polynomials in real-life scenarios such as area, volume, and motion problems.
