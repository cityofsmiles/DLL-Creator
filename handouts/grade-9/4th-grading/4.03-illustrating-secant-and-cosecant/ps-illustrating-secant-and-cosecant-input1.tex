Solve the following problems. Write your answers in simplest fractional form where applicable.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 10 units, and the adjacent side is 8 units. Find $\sec A$.
  %  \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 13 units, and the adjacent side is 12 units. Find $\sec B$.
    \item In a right triangle, $\sec C = \dfrac{5}{4}$. If the adjacent side is 8 units, find the hypotenuse.
%    \item In a right triangle, $\csc D = \dfrac{7}{5}$. If the opposite side is 10 units, find the hypotenuse.
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 25 units, and the opposite side is 24 units. Find $\csc E$.
%    \item A right triangle has $\sec F = \dfrac{13}{12}$. If the adjacent side is 36 units, find the hypotenuse.
   % \item In a right triangle, $\csc G = \dfrac{17}{15}$. If the opposite side is 30 units, find the hypotenuse.
    \item A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 26 units and an adjacent side of 24 units. Find $\sec H$.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\sec J = \dfrac{10}{8}$. If the adjacent side is 16 units, find the hypotenuse.
    \item In a right triangle, $\csc K = \dfrac{9}{7}$. If the opposite side is 14 units, find the hypotenuse.
\end{enumerate}
