\textbf{Lesson 1.4: Adding and Subtracting Simple Monomials}
\end{center}

%\begin{itemize}
  %  \item 
    \textbf{Monomial:} An algebraic expression with only one term. Examples include \( 4x \), \( -3y^2 \), and \( 7 \).
    
   % \item 
    \textbf{Like Terms:} Terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. For example, \( 2x \) and \( -5x \) are like terms, but \( 3x \) and \( 4y \) are not.
  %  \item 
  
    \textbf{Adding/Subtracting Monomials:} You can add or subtract monomials by combining like terms. For example, \( 3x + 5x = 8x \) and \( 6y^2 - 2y^2 = 4y^2 \).
