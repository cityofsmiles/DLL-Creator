Identify the parts of the given circle based on the description.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the given circle, point $P$ is the fixed point from which all other points are equidistant. What is this point called?
  %  \item The segment $XY$ passes through the center of the circle and has endpoints on the circle. What is the name of this segment?
    \item A line segment $LM$ has both endpoints on the circle but does not pass through the center. What is this called?
   % \item The line $RS$ passes through the circle at two distinct points. What is the name of this line?
    \item The line $UV$ touches the circle at exactly one point. What is this line called?
    %\item The curved part between two points on the circle is called what?
    \item What do we call an arc that measures less than $180^\circ$?
    %\item An arc that measures more than $180^\circ$ is known as what?
    \item An angle formed by two radii with its vertex at the center is called what?
    %\item An angle whose vertex is on the circle and sides contain chords is called what?
\end{enumerate}
