\begin{enumerate}
 %   \item A person looks at the top of a 10-meter flagpole with an angle of elevation of \(30^\circ\). Find the distance from the person to the base of the flagpole.
 %   \item A 12-meter ladder leans against a wall, forming an angle of elevation of \(60^\circ\) with the ground. Find how high the ladder reaches on the wall.
    \item A hill has an angle of elevation of \(15^\circ\), and a hiker walks 100 meters up the hill. How high does the hiker ascend vertically?
    \item A drone flies at an angle of elevation of \(45^\circ\) from an observer and is 50 meters away horizontally. Find the altitude of the drone.
  %  \item From a boat, the angle of elevation to the top of a lighthouse is \(20^\circ\). The boat is 40 meters away from the lighthouse. Find the height of the lighthouse.
    \item A ramp is built at an angle of elevation of \(25^\circ\) and has a length of 8 meters. Find the height it rises to.
    \item A tree casts a shadow 15 meters long, and the angle of elevation of the sun is \(40^\circ\). Find the height of the tree.
    \item A plane ascends at an angle of \(10^\circ\) and has traveled 200 meters along its path. Find its vertical ascent.
  %  \item A camera is set at an angle of elevation of \(55^\circ\) to capture the top of a building 30 meters away. Find the height of the building.
 %   \item A streetlight casts a shadow 8 meters long, and the angle of elevation of the light is \(70^\circ\). Find the height of the streetlight.
