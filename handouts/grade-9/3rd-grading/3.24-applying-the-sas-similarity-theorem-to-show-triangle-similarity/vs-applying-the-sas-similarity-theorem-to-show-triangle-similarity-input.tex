\noindent\textbf{SAS Similarity Theorem}: If in two triangles, one pair of corresponding sides are proportional and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label = \color{blue}\arabic*. ]
    \item \textbf{Identify the Two Triangles:} Label the corresponding sides and angles.
    \item \textbf{Check Proportionality of Sides:} Ensure that the ratios of the lengths of corresponding sides are equal.
    \item \textbf{Verify Congruency of Angles:} Check that the included angles between the corresponding sides are congruent.
    \item \textbf{Conclude Similarity:} If the corresponding sides are proportional and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar by the SAS Similarity Theorem.
