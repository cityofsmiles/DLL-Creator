\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{polynomial function} is an expression of the form:
    \[
    P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0
    \]
    where \( a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_1, a_0 \) are real numbers, and \( n \) is a non-negative integer.
    \item The \textbf{degree} of a polynomial is the highest exponent of the variable \( x \).
    \item The \textbf{leading term} is the term with the highest degree.
    \item The \textbf{leading coefficient} is the coefficient of the leading term.
    \item The \textbf{constant term} is the term with no variable (i.e., \( a_0 \)).
\end{itemize}
