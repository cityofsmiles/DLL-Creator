\noindent \textbf{Extraneous Root:} some extra solution that will not satisfy the original equation

\noindent Follow these steps to solve equations with radical expressions (and check for extraneous solutions):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Isolate the radical expression:} Move one of the radical expressions to one side of the equation if necessary.    
    \item \textbf{Square both sides of the equation:} This eliminates the radical on one side, but remember to simplify both sides.    
    \item \textbf{Solve the resulting equation:} Simplify and solve the equation for the unknown variable.
    \item \textbf{Check for extraneous solutions:} Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to check whether they are valid or extraneous.
    \end{enumerate}
