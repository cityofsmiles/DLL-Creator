Solve the following real-life problems using the Law of Sines.  

\begin{enumerate}
    % \item A hiker is standing 80 m from the base of a hill. The angle to the top of the hill is \(50^\circ\). From a second point 50 m farther away, the angle to the top is \(40^\circ\). Find the height of the hill.
    % \item A weather balloon is 100 m above the ground. From two points 70 m apart, the angles of elevation to the balloon are \(60^\circ\) and \(45^\circ\). Find the distance of the balloon from the closer point.
    % \item Two ships are 150 km apart. From one ship, the angles to an island are \(40^\circ\) and \(60^\circ\). Find the distance from the first ship to the island.
    % \item A building casts a shadow 20 m long when the angle of elevation of the sun is \(45^\circ\). A nearby tree casts a shadow when the angle of elevation is \(30^\circ\). Find the height of the tree.
    % \item A hot air balloon is at an altitude of 300 m. The angles of elevation to the balloon from two points 150 m apart on the ground are \(40^\circ\) and \(50^\circ\). Find the distance of the balloon from the closer point.
    \item A triangular lot has sides measuring 250 m and 180 m, with an included angle of \(50^\circ\). Find the length of the third side.
    \item Two planes flying at the same altitude form angles of \(50^\circ\) and \(70^\circ\) with a control tower. If the planes are 700 m apart, find the distance of each plane from the tower.
    \item A motorboat travels 8 km west, then turns and travels at an angle of \(130^\circ\) to its original course for 12 km. How far is the motorboat from the starting point?
    \item A tree is 60 m tall. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is \(40^\circ\), and the angle to a nearby tower is \(70^\circ\). If the tree is 300 m from the tower, find the height of the tower.
    \item Two airplanes are at different altitudes. The angles of elevation from an observer on the ground to the airplanes are \(35^\circ\) and \(55^\circ\). If the airplanes are 600 m apart, find the distance of each airplane from the observer.
\end{enumerate}
