\vspace*{-1.5ex}

When events \( A \) and \( B \) are non-mutually exclusive, they can occur simultaneously. The probability of their union is:

{\centering $ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $\par}

\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P(A) \) is the probability of event \( A \)
    \item \( P(B) \) is the probability of event \( B \)
    \item \( P(A \cap B) \) is the probability of both events occurring simultaneously (the intersection of \( A \) and \( B \))
\end{itemize}
