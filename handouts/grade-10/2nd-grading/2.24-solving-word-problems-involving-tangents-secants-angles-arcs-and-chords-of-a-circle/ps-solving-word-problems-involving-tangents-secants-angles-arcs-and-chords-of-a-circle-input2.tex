Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. One secant intercepts arcs measuring $130^\circ$ and $50^\circ$. Find the measure of the angle formed by the secants.
  %  \item A secant and a tangent meet at a point outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $110^\circ$ and $40^\circ$. Find the angle formed.
    \item Two chords intersect inside a circle. One arc measures $70^\circ$ and the other measures $90^\circ$. Find the measure of the angle formed by the intersecting chords.
   % \item A tangent to a circle measures $18$ cm. A secant from the same external point has an external segment of $10$ cm and a total length of $x$. Solve for $x$.
    \item Two chords intersect in a circle. The segments of the first chord measure $8$ cm and $16$ cm. One segment of the second chord is $12$ cm. Find the other segment.
  %  \item A tangent measures $22$ cm, and a secant has an external part of $14$ cm and a total length of $x$. Solve for $x$.
    \item Two secants intersect outside a circle. One secant intercepts arcs of $150^\circ$ and $60^\circ$. Find the measure of the external angle.
   % \item A circle has a secant with an external segment of $13$ cm and a total length of $26$ cm. Find the length of the tangent from the same external point.
    \item Two intersecting chords divide into segments measuring $6$ cm and $18$ cm, and $7$ cm and $x$ cm, respectively. Solve for $x$.
   % \item A secant has an external segment of $9$ cm and a total length of $27$ cm. Find the length of the tangent from the same external point.
