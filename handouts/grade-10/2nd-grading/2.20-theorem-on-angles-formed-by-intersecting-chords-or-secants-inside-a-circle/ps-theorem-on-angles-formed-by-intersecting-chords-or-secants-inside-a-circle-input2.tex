Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two chords intersect inside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $110^\circ$ and $70^\circ$. Find the measure of the interior angle.
%    \item Two secants intersect inside a circle. The angle formed measures $85^\circ$. If one intercepted arc is $120^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    \item The intercepted arcs of two chords measure $140^\circ$ and $90^\circ$. Find the measure of the interior angle.
   % \item Two secants intersect inside a circle. The interior angle measures $65^\circ$, and one intercepted arc is $80^\circ$. Find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    \item Find the measure of the interior angle formed by two chords intercepting arcs measuring $160^\circ$ and $100^\circ$.
  %  \item A chord-chord angle measures $75^\circ$. If one of the intercepted arcs is $130^\circ$, find the measure of the other intercepted arc.
    \item Two chords form an interior angle of $95^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $110^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    %\item The interior angle formed by two chords is $90^\circ$. The intercepted arcs differ by $40^\circ$. Find their measures.
    \item Two secants intersect inside a circle, creating an angle of $78^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc measures $150^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    %\item The intercepted arcs of two chords measure $200^\circ$ and $140^\circ$. Find the measure of the interior angle.
