Solve the following problems. Write your answers in simplest fractional form where applicable.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 12 units, and the side opposite angle $P$ is 5 units. Find $\sin P$.
    \item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 10 units, and the side adjacent to angle $Q$ is 6 units. Find $\cos Q$.
   % \item In a right triangle, $\sin R = \dfrac{4}{5}$. If the hypotenuse is 25 units, find the length of the side opposite angle $R$.
    \item In a right triangle, $\cos S = \dfrac{5}{13}$. If the adjacent side is 5 units, find the hypotenuse.
    %\item In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 20 units, and the side adjacent to angle $T$ is 12 units. Find $\cos T$.
    \item A right triangle has $\sin U = \dfrac{3}{5}$. If the hypotenuse is 15 units, find the opposite side.
    %\item In a right triangle, $\cos V = \dfrac{12}{13}$. If the hypotenuse is 26 units, find the length of the adjacent side.
    %\item A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 25 units and an adjacent side of 20 units to angle $W$. Find $\cos W$.
   % \item In a right triangle, $\sin X = \dfrac{5}{13}$. If the hypotenuse is 39 units, find the side opposite angle $X$.
    \item In a right triangle, $\cos Y = \dfrac{7}{25}$. If the adjacent side is 7 units, find the hypotenuse.
\end{enumerate}
