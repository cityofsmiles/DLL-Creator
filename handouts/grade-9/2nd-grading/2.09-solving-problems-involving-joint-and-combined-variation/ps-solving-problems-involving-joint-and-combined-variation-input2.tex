\item The surface area \(S\) of a sphere varies jointly as its radius \(r\) and height \(h\). If \(S = 200\) square units when \(r = 4\) units and \(h = 8\) units, find \(S\) when \(r = 6\) units and \(h = 9\) units.
%    \item The area \(A\) of a rectangle varies jointly as its length \(l\) and width \(w\). If \(A = 40\) when \(l = 5\) and \(w = 8\), find \(A\) when \(l = 6\) and \(w = 9\).
   \item The number of workers \(w\) required to complete a task varies directly as the size of the task \(s\) and inversely as the time \(t\). If \(w = 8\) workers when \(s = 120\) units and \(t = 10\) hours, find \(w\) when \(s = 150\) units and \(t = 8\) hours.
    \item The volume \(V\) of a cylinder varies jointly as the area of its base \(B\) and its height \(h\). If \(V = 150\) cubic units when \(B = 15\) square units and \(h = 10\) units, find \(V\) when \(B = 18\) square units and \(h = 12\) units.
    \item The intensity \(I\) of sound varies directly as the amplitude \(A\) of the sound and inversely as the square of the distance \(d\). If \(I = 150\) when \(A = 60\) and \(d = 3\) meters, find \(I\) when \(A = 70\) and \(d = 4\) meters.
    \item The force \(F\) acting on an object varies jointly as its mass \(m\) and the acceleration \(a\). If \(F = 80\) N when \(m = 8\) kg and \(a = 2\) m/s\(^2\), find \(F\) when \(m = 10\) kg and \(a = 3\) m/s\(^2\).
%    \item The gravitational force \(F\) between two objects varies jointly as the product of their masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), and inversely as the square of the distance \(d\) between them. If \(F = 50\) N when \(m_1 = 5\) kg, \(m_2 = 6\) kg, and \(d = 2\) meters, find \(F\) when \(m_1 = 7\) kg, \(m_2 = 5\) kg, and \(d = 3\) meters.

%    \item The pressure \(P\) of a fluid varies directly as its temperature \(T\) and inversely as its volume \(V\). If \(P = 90\) kPa when \(T = 320\) K and \(V = 5\) liters, find \(P\) when \(T = 350\) K and \(V = 6\) liters.
 
 %   \item The speed \(v\) of a wave varies directly as its frequency \(f\) and inversely as its wavelength \(\lambda\). If \(v = 400\) m/s when \(f = 25\) Hz and \(\lambda = 3\) m, find \(v\) when \(f = 30\) Hz and \(\lambda = 4\) m.
%    \item The current \(I\) in an electric circuit varies directly as the voltage \(V\) and inversely as the resistance \(R\). If \(I = 12\) A when \(V = 120\) volts and \(R = 10\) ohms, find \(I\) when \(V = 140\) volts and \(R = 7\) ohms.
