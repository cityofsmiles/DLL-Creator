For each dataset, calculate and interpret the percentile rank of the given value \(X\):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dataset: \(9, 14, 18, 22, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 48\); \(X = 27\)  
    \item Dataset: \(4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31\); \(X = 19\)  
    \item Dataset: \(6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42\); \(X = 22\)  
    \item Dataset: \(5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41\); \(X = 25\)  
    \item Dataset: \(12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48\); \(X = 36\)  
    \item Dataset: \(3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48\); \(X = 28\)  
    \item Dataset: \(1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37\); \(X = 21\)  
    \item Dataset: \(6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60\); \(X = 36\)  
    \item Dataset: \(8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 50, 56, 62\); \(X = 44\)  
    \item Dataset: \(2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38\); \(X = 26\)
