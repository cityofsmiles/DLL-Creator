Solve each problem completely.

\begin{enumerate}
    % \item A person standing 40 meters away from a building observes its top with an angle of elevation of \(35^\circ\). Find the height of the building.
    % \item A kite is flying at an angle of elevation of \(50^\circ\) and is 80 meters away from its handler. Find the altitude of the kite.
    % \item From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of a 15-meter pole is \(60^\circ\). Find the distance from the point to the base of the pole.
    % \item A ramp is inclined at \(30^\circ\) and is 4 meters long. Find the height the ramp rises to.
    % \item An observer spots a balloon at an angle of elevation of \(45^\circ\). If the balloon is 40 meters above the ground, find the horizontal distance to the balloon.
    \item A tree casts a shadow 10 meters long, and the angle of elevation of the sun is \(40^\circ\). Find the height of the tree.
    \item A drone is observed at an angle of elevation of \(20^\circ\) and is 70 meters horizontally from the observer. Find the altitude of the drone.
    \item A man standing 25 meters away from a tower observes its top at an angle of elevation of \(40^\circ\). Find the height of the tower.
    \item A ladder leans against a wall, forming an angle of elevation of \(70^\circ\) with the ground. The ladder is 5 meters long. Find how high it reaches on the wall.
    \item A person looks at the top of a hill with an angle of elevation of \(25^\circ\). If the person is standing 140 meters away from the hill's base, find the height of the hill.
