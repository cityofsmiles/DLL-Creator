\textbf{Lesson 2.5: Finding the Volume of Pyramids (Non-Square and Non-Rectangular)}
\end{center}

\vspace*{1ex}

To calculate the volume \(V\) of various types of pyramids, including triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal pyramids, use the formula:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
\]

where the \(\text{Base Area}\) is the area of the base of the pyramid, and the \(\text{Height}\) is the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex of the pyramid.

\noindent\textbf{Steps to Calculate the Volume of a Pyramid}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the shape of the base of the pyramid (e.g., triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal).
    \item Calculate the area of the base using the appropriate formula for that shape.
    \item Identify the height of the pyramid, which is the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex.
    \item Apply the volume formula.
%    \[
%    V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
 %   \]
    \item Simplify the expression to find the volume of the pyramid.
\end{enumerate}
