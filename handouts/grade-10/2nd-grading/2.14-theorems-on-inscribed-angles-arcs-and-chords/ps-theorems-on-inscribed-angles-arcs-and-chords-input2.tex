Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts an arc measuring $130^\circ$.
 %   \item Two inscribed angles subtend the same arc. If one of them measures $50^\circ$, find the measure of the other.
    \item A chord of a circle has a length of $12$ cm. If the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord is $5$ cm, find the radius of the circle.
   % \item In a circle, a central angle measures $110^\circ$. Find the measure of an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.
    \item A tangent and a chord intersect at a point on the circle. If the angle between them measures $40^\circ$, find the measure of the intercepted arc.
    %\item Find the length of a chord that is $6$ cm away from the center of a circle with a radius of $8$ cm.
    \item Two chords of a circle are congruent. Show that they are equidistant from the center.
    %\item If an inscribed angle is $55^\circ$, find the measure of the intercepted arc.
    \item Find the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords that intercept arcs measuring $90^\circ$ and $70^\circ$.
    %\item If the radius of a circle is $15$ cm and a chord is $14$ cm long, find its distance from the center.
