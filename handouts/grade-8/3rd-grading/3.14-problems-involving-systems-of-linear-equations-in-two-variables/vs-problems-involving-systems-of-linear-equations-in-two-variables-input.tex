\noindent\textbf{Steps for Solving Word Problems Using Systems of Linear Equations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Understand the problem:} Read the problem carefully and determine what quantities the variables represent.
    \item \textbf{Set up the equations:} Write two linear equations that model the relationships between the variables based on the given information.
    \item \textbf{Solve the system:} Use either substitution, elimination, or graphing to solve the system of equations.
    \item \textbf{Interpret the solution:} Relate your solution back to the context of the problem and check if it makes sense.
\end{enumerate}
