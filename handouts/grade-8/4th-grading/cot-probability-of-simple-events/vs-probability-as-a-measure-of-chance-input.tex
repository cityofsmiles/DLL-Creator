\textbf{Lesson 4.9: Probability of Simple Events}
\end{center}

\vspace*{-1ex}

\noindent\textbf{Probability} is the measure of how likely an event is to happen, given as a fraction, decimal, or percentage.

    \noindent The formula for probability is:

{\centering $ P(\text{Event}) = \dfrac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} $\par}
    \noindent Probability is useful in \textbf{biology}, especially in genetics, disease predictions, and population studies.
    
    \noindent A \textbf{Punnett square} is a tool that helps determine the probability of inheriting specific traits.
    
    \noindent Probability can be used to predict the chance of inheriting a \textbf{dominant} or \textbf{recessive} allele.
    
    \noindent It can also be applied to ecological studies, such as predicting the likelihood of an organism carrying a specific mutation.
