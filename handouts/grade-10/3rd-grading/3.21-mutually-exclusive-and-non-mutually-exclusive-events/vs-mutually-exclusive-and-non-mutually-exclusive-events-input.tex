\noindent \textbf{Mutually Exclusive Events:} Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. That is, the occurrence of one event excludes the possibility of the other event happening. 

\noindent \textbf{Non-Mutually Exclusive Events:} Two events are non-mutually exclusive if they can happen at the same time. The occurrence of one event does not exclude the possibility of the other event happening.

\noindent\textbf{Step-by-Step Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the events involved in the problem.
    \item Check whether the events can happen simultaneously (i.e., whether they share common outcomes).
    \item If the events cannot happen at the same time, they are mutually exclusive.
    \item If the events can happen at the same time, they are non-mutually exclusive.
\end{enumerate}
