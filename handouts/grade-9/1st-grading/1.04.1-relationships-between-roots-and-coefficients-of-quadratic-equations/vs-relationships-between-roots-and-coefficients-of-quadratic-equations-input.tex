\noindent\textbf{Vieta's Formulas} For quadratic equations of the form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $, 

\textbf{Sum of the Roots:} the sum of the roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the quadratic equation is equal to the negative coefficient of the $x$ term divided by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term. 
$$\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}$$

\textbf{Product of the Roots:} the product of the roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the quadratic equation is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term. $$\alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}$$
