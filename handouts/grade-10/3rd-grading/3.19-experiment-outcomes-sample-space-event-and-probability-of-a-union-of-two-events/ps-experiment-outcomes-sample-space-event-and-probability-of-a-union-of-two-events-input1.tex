Solve the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item An experiment consists of rolling a fair die. Let event \(A\) be rolling a number greater than 3, and event \(B\) be rolling an even number. What is the probability of the union of events \(A\) and \(B\)?
    \item In a bag, there are 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 6 green balls. Let event \(A\) be selecting a red ball, and event \(B\) be selecting a green ball. What is the probability of selecting a red or green ball?
    \item A deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled. Let event \(A\) be drawing a spade, and event \(B\) be drawing a face card. What is the probability of drawing a spade or a face card?
    \item A spinner has 8 sections, numbered 1 to 8. Let event \(A\) be spinning a number greater than 4, and event \(B\) be spinning an even number. What is the probability of spinning a number greater than 4 or an even number?
 %   \item A jar contains 10 marbles: 3 red, 4 blue, and 3 green. Let event \(A\) be selecting a red marble, and event \(B\) be selecting a blue marble. What is the probability of selecting either a red or blue marble?
    \item A coin is flipped. Let event \(A\) be getting heads, and event \(B\) be getting tails. What is the probability of getting heads or tails?
    % \item A survey of 100 students shows that 40 students like basketball, 50 students like soccer, and 30 students like both basketball and soccer. What is the probability of a student liking either basketball or soccer?
    % \item A box contains 10 light bulbs: 6 are working, and 4 are not working. Let event \(A\) be selecting a working bulb, and event \(B\) be selecting a bulb that is not working. What is the probability of selecting either a working or non-working bulb?
    % \item A group of 12 students is surveyed. Let event \(A\) be a student who plays football, and event \(B\) be a student who plays basketball. If 5 play football, 6 play basketball, and 3 play both, what is the probability that a randomly selected student plays either football or basketball?
    % \item A lottery has 100 tickets. 25 tickets win a prize, and 15 tickets are marked as lucky. Let event \(A\) be selecting a winning ticket, and event \(B\) be selecting a lucky ticket. What is the probability of selecting either a winning or lucky ticket?
