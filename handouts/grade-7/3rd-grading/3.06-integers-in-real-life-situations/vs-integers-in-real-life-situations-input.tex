Positive and negative numbers can be used to describe directions or opposites in real-life situations. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Temperatures above or below zero.
    \item Gains and losses in money.
    \item Elevations above or below sea level.
    \item Movements up or down in an elevator.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Positive numbers indicate an increase, gain, or movement in one direction, while negative numbers indicate a decrease, loss, or movement in the opposite direction.
