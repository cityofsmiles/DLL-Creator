\noindent\textbf{Steps to Sketch the Graph Using the Slope and a Point}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identify the slope} of the line (given as $m$).
    \item \textbf{Plot the given point} on the Cartesian plane.
    \item \textbf{Use the slope} to determine the rise and run. From the given point, move up or down (rise) and left or right (run) according to the slope.
    \item \textbf{Plot another point} using the slope.
    \item \textbf{Draw a straight line} through the two points.
\end{enumerate}
