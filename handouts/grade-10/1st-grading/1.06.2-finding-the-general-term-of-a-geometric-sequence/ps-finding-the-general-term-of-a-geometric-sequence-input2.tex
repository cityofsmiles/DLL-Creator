Find the general term and the specified term in the given geometric sequences.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the 6th term of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 4 \) and \( r = 3 \).
    \item Find the 8th term of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 6 \) and \( r = 4 \).
    \item Find the general term of the geometric sequence: 3, 9, 27, 81, ...
    \item Find the 10th term of the geometric sequence: 5, 15, 45, 135, ...
    \item Find the general term of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 8 \) and \( r = \dfrac{1}{4} \).
    \item Find the 5th term of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 10 \) and \( r = -3 \).
    \item Find the general term of the geometric sequence: \(2, \dfrac{2}{5}, \dfrac{2}{25}, \dfrac{2}{125}, ...\)
    \item Find the 7th term of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 3 \) and \( r = -4 \).
    \item Find the general term of the geometric sequence: 15, 30, 60, 120, ...
    \item Find the 12th term of the geometric sequence where \( a_1 = 7 \) and \( r = \dfrac{3}{7} \).
