Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two tangents intersect outside a circle. The intercepted arcs measure $140^\circ$ and $40^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
 %   \item Two tangents intersect outside a circle, forming an angle of $45^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $60^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    \item The intercepted arcs of two tangents measure $170^\circ$ and $50^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
    %\item Two tangents intersect outside a circle. The exterior angle measures $55^\circ$, and the minor intercepted arc is $80^\circ$. Find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    \item Find the measure of the exterior angle formed by two tangents intercepting arcs measuring $160^\circ$ and $60^\circ$.
   % \item A tangent-tangent angle measures $50^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc is $150^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    \item Two tangents form an exterior angle of $65^\circ$. If the minor intercepted arc measures $90^\circ$, find the measure of the major intercepted arc.
    %\item The exterior angle formed by two tangents is $50^\circ$. The intercepted arcs differ by $70^\circ$. Find their measures.
    \item Two tangents intersect outside a circle, creating an angle of $48^\circ$. If the major intercepted arc measures $160^\circ$, find the minor intercepted arc.
    %\item The intercepted arcs of two tangents measure $190^\circ$ and $110^\circ$. Find the measure of the exterior angle.
