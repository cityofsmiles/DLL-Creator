\textbf{Lesson 2.10.1: Solving Right Triangles using the Pythagorean Theorem}
\end{center}

%\vspace*{1ex}

\textbf{Pythagorean Theorem:} In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is represented by the formula:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of the triangle,
    \item \(c\) is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).
\end{itemize}
