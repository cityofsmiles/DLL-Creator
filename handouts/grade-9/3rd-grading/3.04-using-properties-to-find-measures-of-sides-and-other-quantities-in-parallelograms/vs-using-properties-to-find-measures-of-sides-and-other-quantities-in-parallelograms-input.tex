\noindent In a parallelogram, the following properties help in finding unknown side lengths and related quantities:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item Opposite sides are congruent.
    \item Opposite angles are congruent.
    \item Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).
    \item Diagonals bisect each other.
\end{enumerate}
