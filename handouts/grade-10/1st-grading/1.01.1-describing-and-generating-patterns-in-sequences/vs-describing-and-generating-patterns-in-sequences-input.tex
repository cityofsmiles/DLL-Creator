\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{sequence} is an ordered list of numbers following a specific pattern.
    \item The \textbf{general term} (or \textbf{nth term}) of a sequence, denoted as $a_n$, provides a rule to determine any term in the sequence.
    \item A sequence can be \textbf{arithmetic} (where each term increases by a constant difference) or \textbf{geometric} (where each term is multiplied by a constant ratio).
    \item To generate a sequence from the nth term, substitute the values of $n$ into the formula.
    \item To describe a pattern, observe how terms change and relate this to the nth term.
\end{itemize}
