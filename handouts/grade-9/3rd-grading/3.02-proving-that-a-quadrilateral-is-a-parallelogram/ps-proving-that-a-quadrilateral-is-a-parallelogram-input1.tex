\noindent Use the given information to determine if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Provide a brief explanation for your answer.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\color{blue}\arabic*.]
    \item A quadrilateral has both pairs of opposite sides measuring 6 cm each.
    \item A quadrilateral has both pairs of opposite angles equal to \(90^\circ\).
    \item Each pair of consecutive angles in a quadrilateral sums to \(180^\circ\).
    \item The diagonals of a quadrilateral are each divided into two equal parts by their intersection.
    \item One pair of opposite sides in a quadrilateral is both parallel and measures 8 cm.
    \item The diagonals of a quadrilateral divide it into two congruent triangles.
    \item A quadrilateral has one pair of opposite sides that are congruent and one pair that are parallel.
    \item In a quadrilateral, both pairs of opposite angles measure \(110^\circ\) and \(70^\circ\).
    \item The diagonals of a quadrilateral intersect and each diagonal measures 10 cm, with the intersection dividing each into two 5 cm segments.
    \item Both pairs of opposite sides in a quadrilateral are equal in length and parallel.
\end{enumerate}
