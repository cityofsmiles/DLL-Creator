\textbf{Factoring:} the reverse process of getting the product of any number or algebraic expression.

\textbf{Factoring Polynomials:} describing an algebraic expression as the product of two or more expressions

\textbf{Common Factor:} a factor that is contained in every term of an algebraic expression 

\textbf{How to Factor a Polynomial with a Common Monomial Factor}
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item Factor out the greatest common monomial of all terms of the given expression.
    		\item Divide each term of the expression by the greatest common factor. The resulting expression is the other factor.
    	\end{enumerate}
