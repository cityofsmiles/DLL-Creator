\vspace*{-1ex}

\textbf{Rational Algebraic Expression: } a ratio of two polynomials provided that the denominator is not equal to zero 
 
In short, $\dfrac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials and $Q \neq 0$.   

\textbf{Simplest Form:} A rational algebraic expression is in the simplest form if the numerator and the denominator are relatively prime which means that they have no common factor except 1.
		
\textbf{How to Simplify Rational Expressions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Factor the numerator and denominator completely. 
\item Divide any common factors.
\end{enumerate}
