Solve the following problems. Show your solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A secant segment has an external part of $8$ cm and an entire length of $20$ cm. Another secant segment has an external part of $10$ cm. Find its total length if it follows the Secant Segment Theorem.
 %   \item One secant has an external segment of $7$ cm and an internal segment of $21$ cm. Another secant has an external segment of $5$ cm. Find its internal segment.
    \item The external part of a secant is $9$ cm, and the total length is $27$ cm. Another secant has an external part of $12$ cm. Find its total length.
    %\item A secant has an external segment of $6$ cm and an internal segment of $18$ cm. Another secant has an external part of $8$ cm. Find the internal segment.
    \item Two secants extend from an external point. One has an external part of $11$ cm and a total length of $33$ cm. The other secant has an external part of $15$ cm. Find its total length.
    %\item A secant has an external segment of $10$ cm and an internal segment of $40$ cm. Another secant has an external segment of $12$ cm. Find the internal segment.
